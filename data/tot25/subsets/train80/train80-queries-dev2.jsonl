We follow him through the night where he meets all different kinds of people in shaggy places who make his life miserable while the only thing he craves for is to return to the safety of his home.

I never saw the entire movie, I actually walked in on my mom watching it in the middle of the night when I was a kid. Think it might have been around 2002 if I’m remembering correctly, since we lived in a lot of different apartments and I think both this movie and seeing the MJ Blanket incident on the news happened in the same apartment. Rough estimate. Anyway I saw presumably the beginning of the movie. It took place in a pretty old time iirc, maybe in Italy just going off of the architecture and clothing the man was wearing and I think he might have been in some kind of really old-looking art studio. He opened this old box and pulled out this big ball, kind of like a crystal ball but completely opaque white (or maybe kind of marbled). Something happened with the ball and it kind of…swallowed his arm? And started changing shape a bit when it did. I don’t remember what happened before that moment or what happened immediately after, but he died (or maybe his friend, I think he had a friend) and these two women emerged from the ball or were awakened BY the ball, and they were covered in these really thin, see-through cloaks that looked like they were made of cobwebs. I think one of them was blonde, and then they left the ”studio” and started walking down the street, still only wearing the robes. Anyway I think it was turned off and I was put back to bed. I think it might have been on the Sci Fi channel and they have SO MANY original movies that I can’t find this specific one, if it even was a Sci Fi original. Any help is appreciated!"}

This movie was 2D animation and I saw it in the late 90’s or early 2000s, so probably was made in the 80s or early 90s. I’m not sure if the movie is american or european. The film is starred by a boy who was coward. In company of another character he began a fantastic journey, I think into the world of dreams. Maybe the child was afraid by nightmares. At the end of the film appeared the villain, the King of Nightmares, an evil doppelganger of the child. He looked exactly like the child but with gloves and slippers clawed monster, similar to this: http://www.wynsors.com/images/6163096.jpg I think this character appeared in the room of the protagonist.

{"query_id": "223", "query": "Gruesome horror movie with isopods and penis monster .\n Can anyone remember this strange film where a man wants to sleep with a woman and after she leaves, his Penis mutates into a big monster, that bites into his face and kills him? I think in that movie, there were strange crawling creatures, that looked like trilobites or giant isopods. They came from a strange aparatus which could have been a time machine, portal to another dimension or something like that. In one scene you could see a monster in this machine, that looked somewhat like the creature from “nightbeast”. One other scene, I remeber was that sombody takes off his shirt and the chest is full of moving segments like his body is mutating into one of these isopod like creatures. And in another scene, a woman awakens in a sickroom and touches the roses that have been given to her from visitors and these roses shrivel and wither like they have been put into liquid nitrogen and freeze dried. I think it was this woman, who turned the mans penis into the giant carnivorous worm creature and mabe she was like that because she was attacked by one of the strange isopods. But my memories are very blurred, I cant even remember a single dialogue. But I can remeber, that the penis scene frightened me to death and after that, I stoped watching. I saw this movie long time ago. When I was a child, my parents used to buy old VHS cassets from garage sales. Normaly we used them to record TV films, but some of them contained watchable movies. One of them had this strange film on it and was so frightening to me back then. It has been around 1995 to 1998, that I watched it, but the record must have been older. My memories are blurred, I think it was in german language, but probably just a translation. I would guess it was some kind of an american 80’s science fiction horror B-Movie. The Movie was definitely in color and looked like rather low budget, but heavily loaded with absurd body horror and strange mutations. The scenes I remember are scattered and probably twisted, because so much time passed since than and I never saw this movie again. I hope, I dont mix two films together. But I can clearly say, that it is not “Tromeo and Juliet”, which is the only other movie with a “penis monster”, that I know. My parents dont remember the title either, but they recall the movie to be over the top and gruesome and I doubt they will find the original VHS record any time soon. Maybe they have been so disgusted, that they deleted it. I would be very happy if anyone could help me with this film, because I could not manage to find the movie with the help of Google or IMDB, although I searched for days."}

{"query_id": "298", "query": "Dark British Comedy About Murderous Librarian .\n So, twenty years ago I came across a film in our local video rental place.  The movie was a British or Irish comedy that had come out sometime in the mid to late 1990s.  It was about a meek librarian who lived with a domineering mother, had  a bitch of a sister with a thuggish boyfriend and a lover she had to hide from her family.  She was fascinated by great serial killers of the past and eventually several famous ones start appearing to her.  They help guide her in first killing her mother, then her sister and then the sister’s boyfriend.  She ends marrying her lover and sending her “advisors” away because – as she points out – they were all caught and she doen’t want to be. There are two scenes that I particular remember.  The first is after she kills her sister, which she does by doing something to her inhaler.  The sister’s boyfriend decides that she killed her because she wanted him.  They are standing in the kitchen together and he tells her that she can have him if she wants him that badly.  I remember her smiling at him and putting her arms around him before stabbing him in the back with a pair of scissors. The second is the last sense.  She’s on her honeymoon with the man she’s been in love with the entire time and they are lying in bed together.  He has his eyes closed, getting ready to go to sleep and he says that btw he knows she killed her mother.  Something she said at the time didn’t add up but that he understands why she did it and would never tell anyone.  She gets up out of bed after he’s asleep and is trying to figure out to what to do.  She opens the door and there’s a little man in a Victorian suit with a kind of doctor’s bag there who smiles at her and introduces himself very politely as Jack the Ripper.  She smiles back at him and that’s the end of the movie. It’s a very dark comedy but also a very cleaver one that I really enjoyed.  I’d really love to find it again.  There are aspects to the movie that remind me a little of ‘Keeping Mum’ if you know that movie.  However, while the acting in the film is brilliant I don’t remember seeing any of the actors in it before or since. Help?"}

The main character turns on the machine and the creature gets crushed. As I mentioned in the title the movie felt much like an adaptation of a S. King’s book or alike, with MId/low budget."}

I want to say this is an ’80’s-’90s movie. I originally thought it was Gremlins, so thinking it is something out of that dark light-hearted vein."}

It’s sketchy, but I remember one of the girls was strangled with a snake that was hidden in a fur coat. I remember the final scene in this space age looking lab with giant cryogenic capsules that were holding the starlets for the evil scientist’s future “use” The movie had a strong technicolor aspect- that’s pretty much all I got."}

I think the guy and his dad are either estranged or don’t have a very good relationship. I saw it in the mid-late 90’s and I remember this guy fell out of the widow of an apartment.

In the movie, around the beginning, the movie shows him as a performer doing tricks, then he goes and stays at a mans’ house as a guest, they are having a party to celebrate, drinks are served and people are drinking and eating snacks. The next thing I remember is that he is cutting up carrots for a dish and makes it appear that he cuts off his finger. A lady next to him is screaming and he shows her that it was a carrot that he cut and not his finger. Next I remember a scene where the man is being questioned by someone of authority in a small room.

It’s not quite a movie, more like a short.  It could have been its own production, or part of a larger collection. Anyway, it’s set in a desert-region, probably the sahara or india, or somwhere over there……and there’s this arab prince or something, and i guess he’s wealthy to some extent, and he lives in this palace (or at least a very big house).  i think his father dies, and on his deathbed, his father tells him not to open “the door”, which is a big wooden door with iron hinges and locks, which features prominently in the house. now, why he never opened it before this, i’m not sure, but it’s been shut and/or locked until now, so whatever. anyway, his father dies, and the son is seen eating grapes or fruit or something and then he notices the door, and goes over and opens it. he goes down into a dungeon of sorts, and down a dark hallway and suddenly this big huge man with no shirt (kind of like the big bald guy that Indiana Jones fights in Raiders of the Lost Ark) appears out of nowhere, picks him up and dumps him in the middle of the desert for to be left for dead. i always wondered why he doesn’t just go back the way he came, or back to his palace (which is presumably close by) i don’t know.  but you get the impression he’s now a long way away from anything. so he crawls around the desert a bit, and then gets picked up by this beautiful princess and her entourage, and she has him come and stay with her in her palace, and life is great.  but the princess also warns the prince not to open “the door” — because she has a door in her palace living room that looks just like the one that he had!!  big wooden door with iron hinges and all. wtf. ok, so this guy is more curious than george, and he goes over and opens it, goes down the hallway, and suddenly the same big bald man appears and picks him up and dumps him out into the middle of the desert again. as he’s sitting there in the sand, he sees a vision of sorts of the princess riding off on the horizon with her entourage on camels, and she’s basically scolding him about opening the door, and now she’s not going to be with him. somehow, the prince ends up back in his palace again, and the final shot is of him sitting in the living room eating his grapes again, and the camera pans over to “the door”.   the narrator says something cryptic and spooky about having learned his lesson about the door or something like that. It sounds like it could have come from One Thousand and One Nights, or Ali Baba, or Sinbad, or Aladdin, but I have been thus far unable to determine what it was…."}

This movie was so bad we talked and joked through the entire thing like the robots out of MST3K. But it bothers me that none of us can remember the name of the movie or what it was about. The only thing any of us really remember was it took place is completely or mostly in a third world country and near the end this woman, American I think, was standing either topless or naked in a bunch of mud and was surrounded by young boys. Most of whom were somewhere around 12-14 years old. And they start covering her in mud and as they do so, they are groping her breasts and ass. Not sure if they were supposed to, but they were. I think this scene stuck with us because it was about the best part of the movie and the only thing even relatively exciting that happened. We kept watching hoping that it would get better at some point. That someone didn’t actually, from start to finish, make a movie that terrible.

No one on the search team goes too far into the cave system behind the door.

I even watched it online so it’s impossible for me to track down… Anyway, it was definitely a Chinese film taking place in a more historical setting with emperors, generals, war, you know the ususal. The story focused on the relationship between two men. I believe one of the men was of a higher/royal power and the other had some kind of position in their army ??? I’m not quite sure. Either way, they were lovers. At some point everyone kept nagging the higher power (let’s just call him the king) to have an heir, but he was repulsed by sleeping with a woman. So, for some reason he told his lover to sleep with his wife so that she can become pregnant. The lover goes through with it and some time afterwards realizes that he actually enjoyed being with the opposite sex. It gets a bit fuzzy from there, but I do remember the wife and the king’s lover are caught “in the act” inside a storage room or something. The king is so offended that he throws him in prison or castrates him; something like that. I just remember the ending scene being of the two lovers riding on horses in a grass field… Apparently there was a painting they both admired that had the same scene.

The plant involved blood of some sort, and had to remain there, lest her situation revert to the dismal existence.  This “idea” was given to her by some sort of spirit or fairy that she befriended in the woods who gave her hope/vision of a beautiful fantasy land where she belonged (as queen???)

Strange things were happening and there were kid ghosts (they appeared in human form) in the woods. In one scene, the oldest daughter is on her knees on a hill.

The kids had really weird black eyes. And their clothes seemed to be from the 1920’s. It was in color and English. It was on some type of on demand TV service.

{"query_id": "872", "query": "Horror/Slasher Babysitter movie help .\n Okay, this one is going to be packed with random info. I saw this movie on television in the early 90’s when I was 4-5 . The movie was in English and it was in color. I would say the movie is probably from somewhere in the early-to-mid 80’s. A boy walks into a room and notices someone sleeping (or dead) and takes an item from them and walks out. He’s shown to be the stereotypical nerd with glasses and a tucked in, button up shirt. There were scenes of him putting on headphones and tinkering around with what seemed to be a giant computer or radio system. In one class, a bully teases him and he makes a mixture in a beaker and pours it on the bully’s arm. Turns out it was acid. Later on at home, the parents are going out and hire an older woman to babysit him and his sister. One scene has the woman pouring milk for her kitten and puts a box over it as its drinking, but later when she lifts up the box, the kitten is gone. I think the boy appears holding and petting it before her. The boy is shown in either the front yard or backyard, setting up a light sensor system. The bully shows up later, now with a bandaged hand and crosses the sensor, alerting the boy. I think they end up in the garage when the boy shows up with a sword and spiked helmet. A piece of wood or cardboard falls when they scuffle and the bully tries to push it forward but the boy stabs the sword through, killing the bully. Don’t remember how it starts, but the boy and the babysitter fights and he ends up throwing her kitten into the fire. When she’s crying over it, he knocks her out (i think). As she’s on the ground, he gloats and pours alcohol/wine on her face/head. She gets up and I think they fight a bit more and she pushes him. He falls on top of the spiked helmet from earlier and crawls away. The parents come home and she doesn’t respond to them and gets her bike to leave, all the while they’re yelling that she drank all the alcohol. A closeup of the boy’s face is seen staring off into space and we realize he is dead. A hand reaches for his glasses and we see the little sister putting them on. She sits herself down in front of the computer/radio and puts on headphones as the scene freezes and fades out."}

I think the sister noticed the people who lived in the town were doing the same thing over and over again, like the man would walk by and tip his hat, then do it again a few minutes later. By the end of the movie they find out that their parents fell asleep too and ended up in the town and were trapped in these pod type things.
