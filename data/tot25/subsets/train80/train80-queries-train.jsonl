{"query_id": "109", "query": "Zombies created from rain of burnt green alien .\n This is an old movie. As far as I remember, the plot was the following: Some guys stole/found a truck from a military convoy that turns out it had an alien inside. The alien was done by a guy in a bright green suit, kind of silly looking. They decided to kill the alien, by cutting him in parts and burning them in the crematorium. I think, when they cut his hand and other limbs they noticed they remained moving, so it couldn’t be killed. They burnt the body. After which, the smoke from the fire went in the atmosphere, turned into a cloud and rained down over the cemetery. Which of course lead to infecting the dead bodies and they becoming zombies. I think the movie ended as the government nuked the town. Saw this movie a few years back, it looked like 50s – 60s movie. It was in color. I watched it on the MGM channel, so I suspect it is MGM movie. The movie was in English language."}

Most likely it was in black and white and of a Western genre. The plot is not that different from the well known “Curly Sue”, “Alice in the Cities” or even “True Grit” and revolves around a journey of a middle-aged man and a little girl through the Wild West. I remember this man as a corpulent black-bearded cowboy taking care of a girl who was either his daughter or some orphaned child. All I recall is just this one scene: The man and the girl are making pancakes (or tortillas), and the man is showing the girl some sort of a trick – he throws the pancake up into the air, then catches it, then throws and catches it again. At some point, he throws the pancake and it disappears. Then both man and girl lift their eyes and see that the pancake is stuck to the ceiling.

The survivors reason that if the plant is growing this fast at night, then it will be unstoppable once the sun rises.

{"query_id": "323", "query": "Metallic Plates, Alien Artifact(?), Fight on the Beach .\n The genre is sci-fi, action, adventure (but not that much of sci-fi actually). This movie was on TV in the early 80s, so most likely it’s from the 70s. It was a very simple, moderate budget movie without any special effects. It was in color, I think. A young man comes to a provincial seashore town having in his possession a piece of a metallic plate, decorated with strange symbols. As far as I recall they look like Phoenician alphabet. However, this is just a small piece of a bigger artifact, so this guy is looking for the rest of it. I really do not know why he comes to this particular town, most likely he has info that another piece is located somewhere around the area. Also there are other people looking for the same artifacts and they are in a competition. The movie is pivoting around this search and confrontation between the groups. So it’s mostly an action movie. I remember this scene at the very end of the film, this is how the movie ends. The protagonist and his opponent are fighting on the beach, the hero overcomes his enemy and a wave carries out the pieces of the artifact into the sea. The protagonist is walking sadly along the shore and suddenly finds both pieces thrown ashore by the wave. So he takes these two pieces and moves to some different location continuing his search. The end has this feel of the Incredible Hulk TV series. I remember asking my father about these metallic plates and their meaning. He said something like: These were parts of an artifact left by extraterrestrials who visited Earth in ancient times, the text on the plates revealed the date of their return. However, I’m not sure whether he was joking or not."}

At one point, the girl tells the boy to stop making references to horses.   At one point, the girl removes her bra (no nudity is shown, thanks to the camera perspective / clipping).   At the end of the scene, the girl is seen having her hands near/in the boy’s genital area and remarking something like “oh, only so little (liquid)?”.

The movie begins with a brother and sister walking to school. They cross the road which is all cobblestone so I’m assuming it’s a European movie. As they cross the road, the girl gets hit by a car and put into a coma. The family tries everything to wake her but they have no success. They finally find a doctor who says he can put the brother into a coma to rescue her and bring her back so he connects their brain waves through wires or something. The brother finds his sister at a cabin. She is on the pond playing and she slips through the ice. Her brother runs to save her and can bring her out of the water. This wakes her from the coma. I believe the girls name is possibly Frankie. I’m not too sure though. I saw this movie before 2010 but after 2000. It was on tv. It was in color, but very dark. Please try to find it!

In color, in English, rented films, don’t remember if ever on TV, had to have been released very late 80s but possibly up to mid 90s, I believe I would have watched between 1995-98. I remember the 2nd film having like a large alien race with bald/possibly Conehead resemblances that captured the main protagonist. I can’t remember if he traveled via spaceship or what. But those large aliens in movie 2 put him in a large terrarium type of setting like what a tarantula would be in, but I don’t remember if there were any threats like spiders, snakes etc. Film 3 brought the protagonist to a town and I swear one of the characters in the third film was basically a real-life raggedy Anne doll or something. There were other helpers in this town; a convention or type of fall festival was ongoing while the guy visited in search of the crystal or whatever it was he was looking for. Can’t remember films 1, 4, or 6 for the life of me, but I remember that at the end of film 4 there was a preview for the 5th one that included their spaceship or perhaps a subway train or something being attacked by like brown worm like monsters which was going to stop or crash what the protagonist was riding in. I feel like at the beginning of the series he may have been in his room on a computer and brought aboard a spaceship to begin the adventure. He may be brown/darker haired and have a new partner or group of folks tagging along eacf film or a new partner coming on board for the remainder of the adventure. I’m thinking he wasn’t alone. I can’t remember completely but I believe the 2nd film had a yellow vhs box showing large hands reaching into the terrarium, and movie 3 may have been bright pink as the box with the raggtedy Anne character on the cover with the main character and a few others. The ultimate questbor goal was to reunite their crystal shards or collecting so many pieces of a shiny substance. I don’t think they traveled through time, though it is possible.

Have been looking through selections at 366 Weird Movies and not found it yet (btw the way most of those titles are exactly the kind of not-actually-rare movies this film is definitely not)."}

It has the same structure as 10th Kingdom as it’s a series with not so many episodes. The plot goes: Wizards or sages from another world(medieval china iirc) summon a family(a girl and her dad) from our world(in a car) and a witch from a third party world to save their world from evil robots who turn out to be automative APC’s(multiwheeled armored vehicles armed with lasers). The Witch betrays them for her own goals. Robots use drills(someone hides underground in the tunnels/caves) and satelite like antenas to locate the heroes. At one point girl confronts a robot dressed in armor literally made of mirrors(to reflects lasers). She’s shot and knocked unconscious but is alive. Her dad storms a yard in a car(yellow jeep iirc) and the guards can’t stop him until he runs out of gas or the car malfunctions.

His mother was never around because she was at work all the time. He actually got caught by one couple who was at home during one of his robberies and they threatens to call the cops.

I may have some details mixed up, or combined with another drama, so if you have any suggestions at all, please share them. There is a Caucasian man, who is a little person, who is successful in his working life but is lonely in his private life. He may be a writer or editor, or some such professional. I think part of the plot is that he might have trouble making friends because some people are prejudiced against his size. Sometimes he abuses alcohol because of this. He re-connects with a woman he knew when he was a child, even though she used to tease him back when they were children. They become friends and eventually fall in love. She is a regular height woman, also Caucasian, slim and with red hair. In the last scene of the movie, they are dancing on a balcony or rooftop and she is wearing a white dress. Maybe it’s their wedding? I have been through the filmographies of all the male Caucasian little people actors I can think of with no luck. My Googlefu has failed me as well.

I don’t remember the name or any of the actors of the movie, but I remember a lot about it. First off, it was animated. It wasn’t super high quality, the people/things looked like silhouettes (you couldn’t see their faces or exact clothing details, but you could see the shadows of them). Second, it was about a boy and a girl acting out these “plays” in an old theater owned by an old man, who may have been their grandfather. There was also an owl in the theater, and it looked at the camera and hooted whenever they changed from one “play” to another. Third, to change from one costume to another, they stood on a sort of platform thing. It “scanned” them, and the silhouettes of the clothes they described appeared on their bodies. The plays/plots I remember are as follows : Boy gets put in prison (wrongly accused of stealing a necklace, I think), but gets pitied by a princess and she takes him food/clothing. However, the good princess’s evil sister tries to marry the boy when he gets out of prison. When he refuses/realizes she’s the evil princess, she curses him to be a wolf. Boy then eventually gets freed by the good princess. Boy finds himself in a city of gold, but an evil dragon rules the city. The dragon gives the people gold, but only if they sacrifice the most beautiful maiden to the dragon every month/year. Boy eventually slays dragon and marries the girl, who was the most beautiful at that time. Boy is in Africa/similar place and likes to play the drum, but is shunned for doing so. The girl’s father is the clan/tribe chief and is dying from illness. Boy gets thrown out of clan/tribe, but saves an old medicine man from a leopard/big cat. Old medicine man teaches boy how to play drum, which ends up healing the sick clan/tribe chief. The drum also makes the clan/tribe unbeatable in battle. Boy is an adventurer in a strange land where he crawls through a tunnel and gets put in prison. He has to choose/marry one of the king’s three daughters, but he doesn’t know which one. A bee flies around the head of the correct daughter because he fed the bee earlier in the tunnel. He also gets help from other monsters he met in the tunnel/cave.

I saw a movie in July or August 2014, I believe on FOX TV network in the U.S. It was a recent movie, I’d say from the last few years but could be as old as 2000. It was in color and in English and I’m assuming it is American made. For some reason, I swear Kirsten Dunst was in this movie and keep thinking it has something to do with The Virgin Suicides but it is not that movie and I can not find it when searching Kirsten Dunst. The majority of the movie takes place in a hotel or dormitory type building where the doors are numbered. There appears to be a constant party going on in the hallway. In one room, there is some sort of support group where young people gather and I’ve young man reads from a journal if some sort. This scene reoccurs multiple times with fewer and fewer people attending I assume because they were either murdered it committed suicide. In another room, there is a young couple. The male  us in a band. The female is a blonde actress that I thought was Kirsten Dunst but was a female actress I recognized, possibly a Disney actress? They are plotting murder in that room and the girl seems to be trying to leave her family. In another room, there is a girl sitting, hugging her knees. The room is all white. Mental institution? A woman comes in and appears to try to entice her into committing suicide. The theme of the entire movie seems to be that these people are all connected in that they try to convince others to either commit murder or suicide. Another young male is in his room at home, apparently watching deaths online but he can not leave his house. A murder us committed on the streets, by one if the young males. At the end, the male who read from the journal is in the support group room and the male who was in a band comes in and murders him. I believe that us how it ended. It was a very confusing movie as I didn’t see the beginning. I keep wondering if it was a dream but my dreams do not usually follow such patterns. Any help offered will be greatly appreciated.

They succeed in escaping, and are later joined by the brother and bodyguard dude, much to the chagrin of suave guy, who thought he was ditching the weaker elements. Sister says she would never leave them, they’re her family. Later, the sister gets captured and taken to some sort of facility where she gets strapped to a gurney.
