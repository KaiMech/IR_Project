{"query_id": "116", "query": "help .\n I’m looking for an old black & white movie about a woman that visits a small town where she checks into an Inn. There is a trap door in the floor of her room at the inn. There is a run down old church on the town square. Also, there is an antique shop where the visiting lady borrows an old book. Some of the towns people are evil but the old preacher in the church is not. I think the lady that runs the antiques shop is the daughter of the old preacher. The movie set is very simple but very creepy. The towns people are equally as creepy. I think the evil towns people meet once a year"}
{"query_id": "119", "query": "Astronauts/Sci-Fi Movie w/Planet that has different surrface time to that of it’s orbit .\n From what I remember it involved 3-4 astronauts.  One stays in orbit (a black man), while the others go to the surface of this planet. The ones on the surface are there to retrieve data (from probes perhaps?). The astronauts on the surface only have a limited time to collect this data and get back to the ship in orbit.  I think something happens to shorten their time there (a storm maybe?).  During this scene they were surrounded by water if I remember correctly. The female (possibly the crew leader?) keeps saying she can finish the data collection in time because it’ll be ages before they can get another chance.  She says this despite the warnings from her comrades to just leave.  Well, they miss their chance to get back to the ship in orbit. Now the kicker is that the time on the planet’s surface is vastly different to the time in orbit.  For instance, on the surface perhaps only a few hours pass, but in orbit several years pass.  I think it ends up being something like 20+ years to the man in orbit before the surface crew gets back. Anyone know what this movie is?  I watched it in the last 3 years, but I streamed it so the movie itself could be older.  Although I don’t think it would be more then say ten years old.  It’s in colour, an American film in English."}
{"query_id": "125", "query": "Movie about war with Native Americans .\n So this may be a tricky one. I remember having watched this film (highly possible that it was a miniseries) when I was a kid, I am 24 now and I believe I was under the age of 10 when I watched this. I remember watching it on the TV, it was in color, and the actors used English. Based on the graphics I would say that the feature came out sometime after 1980. Here are the snapshot scenes that I remember: A white woman (middle age) is shot in the knee by an arrow during an attack by Native Americans, she is then approached by a Native American who wraps some sort of beaded leather around her injured knee. Another scene: a woman desperately clings to and cries in agony as her dead baby is taken away in a carriage (maybe a sled). Another scene: a woman (think she was Asian) and a man (African American) are surrounded by a group of outlaws?, the outlaws stab the man ( I think he was stabbed in the armpit/rib area. The Asian woman is then hung by the outlaws, she was wearing a red dress. I also remember the woman who was shot in the knee living in a house with other women, one of whom has a baby. Woman with the baby considers shooting her child during the Native American attack to spare her child from capture or a more gruesome death. At another point, the slaves or servants (I don’t know if they were slaves but I do remember that they were African American) are hung by the Native Americans (though its possible that someone else hung the slaves. I really hope someone can help identify this movie/miniseries, I’ve read through dozens of descriptions of Westerns and nothing seems to quite fit. My mother, who also watched this, remembers the scenes I described but the not the name of the feature."}

There’s three scenes I can remember briefly, okay so the first one, the boy imagines this other boy riding into or he imagines himself diverting the boy into a large dumpster or a skip, okay the first one either happens like that or the boy imagined himself beating up the boy into the dumpster. Okay the second scene the boy and girl are karate practice and again the boy imagines a different result, I think he might have imagined himself showing off or something. Okay this one I know for sure, the boy and girl went through like a fight and he turns up at the girls family event and they don’t say anything they just slowly dance and thats the end, the girl had blonde hair and was wearing purple I think.

{"query_id": "239", "query": "Sad, Fantasy Movie – Young Boy in Burned Down House .\n I saw the movie in the early 90s, English language, and in color. I watched it on TV, but I believe it was a feature film. The ending involved a young boy, probably 8-10 years old, walking around a burnt out house. I think there were firefighters walking around in full gear, ignoring the boy. The house was burned enough that it was exposed to the outside. I don’t know if his family was dead or simply gone, but he was apparently left alone after returning from some adventure. I believe the whole movie had a somber, sad tone and may have been a  fantasy in line with the Jim Henson movies of that time period (Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, etc).

{"query_id": "384", "query": "Thriller movie with cult .\n i have seen this movie around a decade or two. It is colored. It is in english language. The plot is: the man (i forgot if it is a priest or a police… or neither) is investigating a cult slash village because there is something fishy about the town. The kids (might include teenagers) are missing. And it is because they are being collected by the mysterious cult. The nice thing about this movie is that the kids that are being collected should be physically beautiful (dont get me wrong what beautiful means, i just want to remember this movie). They are being collected because satan is coming back to earth beautifully. The scene i remember: the child is riding a horse in her nightgown and or with or without the man who is investigating. I think she was trying to seduce him if he was there with her on the horse. There is another scene that one of them, the child or the man is being dragged by the horse alone. Noone is on top of the horse. But it is sort of controlled by the cult using powers. Some of the kids are found but they are all kind of asleep or their faces are all cut off. The kid is the last one already for the preparation of the coming of satan here on earth to be beautiful. The dialogue i remember was: satan is coming back to earth beautiful. May not be exact. Ending: i think the cult didn’t succeed. You can say it was a happy ending for a thriller/horror movie. Or i could be wrong. Pls help me find the title.
