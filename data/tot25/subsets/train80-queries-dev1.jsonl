When people were about to die, they would hear the sea singing to them (I seem to recall that everyone present could hear it, not just the person dying. Also not sure if that was death in general, or just death by foot-worm). 3. There were doctors who would operate on people with “magic” gloves that would allow them to reach into people’s bodies without making incisions – there was some sort of training involved, and one of the main characters failed to save someone’s life because he couldn’t get the gloves to penetrate the patient’s skin. 4. It was set in a Victorian-esque setting, with horse drawn carriages 5. There was a firm divide between an area of permanent darkness and an area of light (can’t remember if the light area ever experienced night, but the dark one would never get day) 6. There was a scene where a king (or some such prominent royalty/courtier) was assassinated by having one of the aforementioned worms inserted into his food while he was sleeping (incidentally, this is the reason I cannot to this day sleep without my feet covered. As a kid this movie freaked me out, so no matter how hot it is, my feet must be covered.) 7. I remember a conversation in a carriage about weather balloons.  I think that was near the beginning, and I have this idea that the main character is from a “normal” reality and this magical place is just as weird to him as it is to the audience.

It was about a woman who at a young age lost her mother and almost died at the funeral but a ghost saved her and from that day on the ghost protected her, then one day once she was an adult she was at a party in an abandoned house I believe and she died at first her spirit is helping her avoid the demons hiding in the darkness after her soul, it was soon reviled that her guardian spirit is actually a demon as well and her mothers spirit is trying to help from what is presumably heaven and the woman has to get to I believe the kitchen and escape through some kind of ventilation shaft or something.

{"query_id": "535", "query": "Catching a parasite alien movie – seen late 80’s .\n I remember watching a movie in the late 80’s about one or more aliens that infected humans. The casualties begin acting stressed, then their eys turn black and then the alien rips out of their bodies. I remember two somewhat more specific occasions. One is a teacher / scientist that starts stressfully writing on the schoolboard, then crouches and the alien rips out of his back, long black nails first. Second is one where the nails come out of the victims face. I believe the movies starts with a girl jogging in a dark setting, some streetlights and may be foggy. Then the view point changes to something chasing her. Im not sure if what happens next is shown, but an important part in the first few scenes of the movie i also remember is a crime-scene with the two main characters: A woman, seemingly not from earth, covering a big out of space like big gun under a trenchcoat, and a man, probably police officer or FBI who sees that woman and knows something is fishy. The woman is there to catch / kill / recapture the alien. The guy helps her throughout the movie. There are several chasing scenes where people try to get away before being infected by the parasite like alien. I remember a scene that points out that coffee is something the woman has never had. And late in the movie I remember that a creature is captured inside a sealed room in spaceship / station. Not sure if its “the mother” and if it escapes. There is a scene where a heavy door that should be closed opens up. I’ve been trying to find this movie for almost 25 years, still remembering all these details. Never found it. Friends say it must be the famous Alien movie, but i don’t think so. I watched it when i was ~9 years old, with my 6 years older nephew.

She thought it took place in medieval Europe and a fifteen year old girl with very curly hair is taken from her family’s castle and accused of witchcraft. Somehow the accusation was related to her eating something taboo on a regular basis. It’s possible she laughs when they come to get her. The girl is imprisoned for years and is raped multiple times by the jailer and becomes pregnant. Her daughter looks just like her. Eventually she and her daughter are released from prison and it has been so long that the woman has trouble with seeing in sunlight. Her jaw is also deformed or broken or locked or something for an unknown reason. She returns to her family home and an artist finds her there and becomes obsessed with her and paints her for the rest of his life. The daughter becomes wealthy because she is savvy. The jailer dies and his casket is taken away in a horse-drawn carriage. I have no definite names of characters or places. No well-known actors according to my patron. My patron also thought that “haunting” or “ghost” might be in the title though I have had no luck with those. She thought she watched the movie in 2011 but that it came out around 2000.  In my experience, patrons can confuse and combine multiple books or films so don’t think that it has to hit all of these points or it is not the right movie.

His wife married to another man and his son, who was with him, is forced to live a life to shun from the creditors. The father raised the son in the way he thought was the best for him, yet when the two was helpless, the son stole a watch from his classmate’s home for tempura resolution – and this marked the beginning of his life as a theft. When the son was finally caught, the father left him alone. The reunion was in the jail cell, where the son loosed his temper, bit the father’s ear while crying. This was when the father realized how much his son had suffered, the pain, despair, and resentment. The son grew up deciding not to be anyone like his father. He went back to return the first watch he’d stolen, at the same time thinking of the good old times with his father. Knowing his father was still alive, he looked from afar at the old man who once bought him endless suffer, but also the childhood memory, when they were both on the same bike, and he leaned against his father’s back, singing along the way and picking wild flowers."}

We would fall asleep watching the TV. Usually I was the last one to fall asleep and so could watch part of a horror movie until commercials came on and I fell asleep from boredom and the TV would run until morning, or I woke up later and caught the ending and turned off the TV. Just giving context ? this was about 10-13 years ago. This channel could only afford older movies but it was in color and english if it helps. So one night I fall asleep and wake up in the middle of the night to catch the middle-to-end of a horror movie. I can’t remember exactly because it was a long time ago, but I can remember the ending very well because it scared the s*** out of me. So this family (father, mother, son and daughter) is running around in the woods, at night and they are screaming each others names. The son gets killed by a hook on the trees or some naked woman with a hook… maybe… The other 3 somehow make it back to the road to their car and quickly get in. The father steps on it. The mother notices that the son is missing so she wants to get out of the car to search for him. The father refuses to stop. The mother then starts saying she saw her mother (the grandma who wasn’t in the movie). She starts screaming again that she wants out to search for her son and mother but the father and daughter start doubting the mothers sanity. She then sits quietly and suddenly jumps out of the car. Now they might have stopped right then or the daughter had to convince the father to go back I can’t remember but she cracked her head and was dead. They put her on the back seat and drive on and keep passing by the same cabin. Here’s some conversation they had: Daughter: “We’ve been passing by that cabin all night” Father: “This is a military road, all the cabins look the same” *some arguing and desperation* Father: “If we keep driving we should be OK” *of course they run out of gas* They keep talking, they get out and try to look around. The camera switches to the mother, she opens her eyes. When the father and daughter come back shes gone. They argue that she was surely dead or now is if she ran into the woods. Now the ending… The father somehow disappeared, can’t remember how, and the daughter starts running. A black car, could have been a Black Volga, is chasing her. She trips, the car stops with the high beams right in her face *tension* the car backs off and as the lights start disappearing she wakes up in a hospital bed surrounded by people, might have been her family, I can’t remember.

However the men are told that they will never be allowed to leave. Now the following details may not be accurate… The director was a person of colour, I think. The movie was Australian. The director had some bit roles in other movies and this was his first directorial venture. It wasn’t a mainstream movie. Thanks!"}

{"query_id": "887", "query": "90s/2000s HORROR MOVIE – Actors on site, B&B with family keeping pregnant women in cave .\n There is a horror movie (color, 90s/2000s, English) about a group of movie actors who go to a rural setting (possibly Scotland/Ireland) to film a movie. There is an old woman and a strange man who run the place they are staying in. There is some sort of lore the old woman speaks of. The heroine ends up at the end of the film discovering a series of tunnels/caves where a pregnant woman is chained. There are psychodelic sequences scattered throughout the film in times of stress…I think including when the heroine is killing or trying to kill the captor/murderer."}

It starts out with this young high school couple at a party and the male is getting very drunk, they both leave the party and he’s driving (no shocker there, they can’t crash unless he drives). You guessed it, they crash coming around a corner into a tree. I can’t remember if they were found, but the girl ends up at this old farmhouse and being held hostage by a gangster (although she’s not tied up, she’s being well taken care of by the gangster, but she’s a prisoner none-the-less), I believe his name was Candy.

{"query_id": "926", "query": "asian film where a man makes other people kill, and then the people forget why .\n I rented this film in the early 2000’s.  It was in color, and may have been a Japanese film, but I can’t be sure.  The plot involves a series of murders, where the “killer” mysteriously gets other people to kill.  After the killings, this man disappears, and the people cannot remember why they killed who they did.  The first murder is a regular customer killing a prostitute.  When the police show up, the man is distraught because he has no memory of the murder. Before the second murder, a man meets the killer on a beach.  The killer says he is lost, I think, and so the man takes the killer home with him.  The man’s wife is asleep upstairs while the two of them engage in a strange conversation.  I think the killer mentions the color of the man’s wife’s niughtgown.  The man kills his wife, and then tries to kill himself when he realizes what he has done.  He first tries to kill himself by throwing himself out a window.  he then tries to kill himself in the police station by running head-first into a wall.  The cop chasing the killer has a sick wife, and eventually catches up to him.  However, I think the killer ends up escaping."}

It was one of those cheap (possibly american italian) exploitation horrors made in late 60s-70s. It all took place in some kind of town/countryside and it was about  two guys who were sent to kill the infected/brainwashed citizens. It started with a scene where guy no.1 talked to guy no.2 over the phone. Guy no.2 was standing inside a phone booth and then one of the citizens attacked him. Citizens wore blue jumpsuits and acted violently for whatever reason. I don’t know if it had to do something with some “alien mind-control” or an infection but I’m pretty sure it wasn’t a zombie movie. It was extra gory too. There was a scene where one of the guys sticked a machine gun through citizen’s chest and then started to shoot the other infected/brainwashed people.

The movie was probably made around that time of the nineties as well. I saw it on television. Some friends were traveling from Canada to Louisiana I believe. I believe they were traveling to Louisiana to pick up a friend’s body for a funeral. The movie takes place in Canada with the main character who claims to be Satan, would find some bum on the street and offer him  $5 for his signature as sale of his soul.  There were some good laughs as he was the leader of his terrible neighborhood band. He also had interest in the friends corpse , as  he believed it belongs to him because he had purchased the soul for $5. He  had a bunch of pictures of the souls he had purchased pinned up on his wall. It was not a horror movie at all I guess you would call it dark humor. It may very well have been a Canadian movie I don’t know."}

She starts selling drugs because of a neighbor she admires. She is delighted with her job as a drugdealer because she starts to obtain benefits, such as food, cellphone and other things that due to her economic situation she could not obtain before because her mom is a prostitute.

Today we were talking about horror movies and my wife and sister-in-law instantly remembered a movie from when they were much younger. The only problem is they don’t remember much about it at all and it’s driving ME crazy more than it is them. So here goes…  They remember watching this in the late 80s or early to mid 90s. Opens with 4 to 6 people (couples?) in an older car driving down a road when they come across the front panel of a house in or on the edge of the woods. It is only the front of the house. They can clearly walk around the side and see that the rest of the house isn’t there. When they open the door it opens to what looks like an abandoned/rundown/spooky house. It’s a horror movie and the house or something within seems to be playing tricks on them as things keep disappearing. There is some sort of supernatural ghostly/zombie/other scary thing(s) there because the characters end up hiding in a room while this “thing” is trying to get in. Movie closes with them driving away in the same car. *Made in the 80s or early 90s and set in the same time.
