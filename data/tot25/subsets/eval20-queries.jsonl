{"query_id": "116", "query": "help .\n I’m looking for an old black & white movie about a woman that visits a small town where she checks into an Inn. There is a trap door in the floor of her room at the inn. There is a run down old church on the town square. Also, there is an antique shop where the visiting lady borrows an old book. Some of the towns people are evil but the old preacher in the church is not. I think the lady that runs the antiques shop is the daughter of the old preacher.

{"query_id": "119", "query": "Astronauts/Sci-Fi Movie w/Planet that has different surrface time to that of it’s orbit .\n From what I remember it involved 3-4 astronauts.  One stays in orbit (a black man), while the others go to the surface of this planet. The ones on the surface are there to retrieve data (from probes perhaps?). The astronauts on the surface only have a limited time to collect this data and get back to the ship in orbit.  I think something happens to shorten their time there (a storm maybe?).  During this scene they were surrounded by water if I remember correctly. The female (possibly the crew leader?) keeps saying she can finish the data collection in time because it’ll be ages before they can get another chance.  She says this despite the warnings from her comrades to just leave.  Well, they miss their chance to get back to the ship in orbit. Now the kicker is that the time on the planet’s surface is vastly different to the time in orbit.  For instance, on the surface perhaps only a few hours pass, but in orbit several years pass.  I think it ends up being something like 20+ years to the man in orbit before the surface crew gets back. Anyone know what this movie is?  I watched it in the last 3 years, but I streamed it so the movie itself could be older.  Although I don’t think it would be more then say ten years old.  It’s in colour, an American film in English."}
{"query_id": "125", "query": "Movie about war with Native Americans .\n So this may be a tricky one. I remember having watched this film (highly possible that it was a miniseries) when I was a kid, I am 24 now and I believe I was under the age of 10 when I watched this. I remember watching it on the TV, it was in color, and the actors used English. Based on the graphics I would say that the feature came out sometime after 1980. Here are the snapshot scenes that I remember: A white woman (middle age) is shot in the knee by an arrow during an attack by Native Americans, she is then approached by a Native American who wraps some sort of beaded leather around her injured knee. Another scene: a woman desperately clings to and cries in agony as her dead baby is taken away in a carriage (maybe a sled). Another scene: a woman (think she was Asian) and a man (African American) are surrounded by a group of outlaws?, the outlaws stab the man ( I think he was stabbed in the armpit/rib area. The Asian woman is then hung by the outlaws, she was wearing a red dress. I also remember the woman who was shot in the knee living in a house with other women, one of whom has a baby. Woman with the baby considers shooting her child during the Native American attack to spare her child from capture or a more gruesome death. At another point, the slaves or servants (I don’t know if they were slaves but I do remember that they were African American) are hung by the Native Americans (though its possible that someone else hung the slaves. I really hope someone can help identify this movie/miniseries, I’ve read through dozens of descriptions of Westerns and nothing seems to quite fit. My mother, who also watched this, remembers the scenes I described but the not the name of the feature."}

The kids (might include teenagers) are missing. And it is because they are being collected by the mysterious cult. The nice thing about this movie is that the kids that are being collected should be physically beautiful (dont get me wrong what beautiful means, i just want to remember this movie). They are being collected because satan is coming back to earth beautifully. The scene i remember: the child is riding a horse in her nightgown and or with or without the man who is investigating. I think she was trying to seduce him if he was there with her on the horse. There is another scene that one of them, the child or the man is being dragged by the horse alone. Noone is on top of the horse. But it is sort of controlled by the cult using powers. Some of the kids are found but they are all kind of asleep or their faces are all cut off.

There was a group of bad guys (the boss was a europan dude) who took it from the ship for some surely bad purpose. Then there was this group of young asian people trying to help it get back to the ship, but not before they had some fun with it. I remember the computer could alter reality for you when you were close enough to it – like this one time when one of the boys was voyeuring a girlfriend behind a window and asking the computer to make her strip down.

The resident of the apartment is a man who wears a mask and gloves, never taking them off. He makes her breakfast. The apartment is full of art and statues and books, almost museum-like. There’s some fancy mirror somewhere and a scene takes place there. The woman at some point is in a cell where she is tortured every day. The only thing keeping her going is a letter she finds hidden in the wall that’s a first hand account of a previous woman being tortured there. When she escapes she realizes the person holding her captive and torturing her was the masked/gloved man. She’s furious and I think leaves. At some point it becomes known that the masked/gloved man was one of the people experimented on by the Angel of Death (Mengele), a nazi doctor who did experiments on twins, handicapped, elderly. The man was referred to as his cell number, and because of the experiments he developed super immunity to either disease (I think). There was a fire at the place where Mengele did the experiments and the man survived but had burns all over his body hence the mask and gloves. At some point the woman comes back. The police I think are after the masked man. I’m not sure if he gets shot, but they’re in the metro station and at some point the woman puts him (I think he was dying?) on a metro car full of flowers and bombs and sends it off to blow up.

I saw this movie on Sky Movies in the early 00s, I think I remember it being shown a lot. It was probably made in the late 90s. It was an American family movie. I’m pretty sure it started with the family moving into the neighbourhood with a pretty full car. And if I remember rightly, the Dad was quite a weighty/hefty dude. Sorry I haven’t included much detail but this is all I can remember! Hopefully the fight scene will ring some bells with somebody. Thanks!"}
{"query_id": "490", "query": "An Angel Falls In Love .\n I’ve seen this movie ages ago. It was french black and white movie from the 60’s. Could be a french new wave movie. There was an angel who fell in love with a girl. Also I think I remember but not sure, is that she tried to commit suicide and he saves her. It was winter time, there was snow outside. And there was a scene at some house party maybe. My memory about that part is fuzzy, but for sure it was french and about an angel in love."}
{"query_id": "498", "query": "3 Fingered demon .\n I remember this movie from when I was younger.   I’ve no idea on the release or when exactly I watched it but it had to of been in the mid to late 80’s. Starts off with the inhabitants of a village all frantic to pack and flee as quickly as they can.   Every so many years this cult would return and bring evil with them. A young girls falls asleep or gets lost while playing with her friends in some tower or water mill type structure.  Her father stays behind searching for her. Two male backpackers traveling across the region wander into the village as the people are fleeing.  They disbelieve the legends told to them or could have not understood the meanings. The cult arrives after the dark falls and begins capturing villagers and hunting down anyone in the area.  Victims caught were hung on a cross and placed before a creature.  It would open its two arms wider revealing a third arm with three fingers extending from its chest.  When placed on the chest of the victim it would burn/brand them leaving a three fingered mark.  They would then become devoted followers. The father ends up being captured later on and he is branded. The two hikers are running down a stone staircase from some cultists when one of them falls.  With an injured leg he can no longer run so his friend pulls him aside and keeps running to lure away the cultists. I’ve no idea who stars in it,   was before my mind payed attention to those parts of the movie.  I’m sure there is more that happens but this bit is what my mind remembers the most."}
{"query_id": "512", "query": "Cannot for the life of me find this movie! .\n I saw this movie sometime around 2011-2014, someone borrowed it from a Redbox, so I would think the movie came out sometime around then. It is set in a fantasy medieval-ish kingdom. Starts of with a man being a guard, or something similar, to a king and somehow a king became a tyrant (or the king died and his son became the tyrant king?). Some people were killed (tried to run and were killed?) including this man’s family. I think this happened during the winter (unless the kingdom was always cold.) Man pretends to be a drunkard who has lost hope and goes home with a prostitute every night, but really isn’t a drunkard and pays the prostitute without actually spending any time with her and goes home, as he is only putting on an act so the king’s men will think he has given up and is not plotting revenge (but he is).  This man along with some other guys are all in on a plan to overthrow the king. Their job is to make shields and somehow use the rivets in the shield (they looked like viking shields with the rivets around the edges, if I remember correctly) as part of their plan, or messaging system to plan the plan. Something of that sort. At some point a man on the inside, as they say, has a daughter that is going to be forced to marry the king, but they smuggle the main character guy inside the castle in an ornate mirror so that he can rescue their inside man’s daughter. I’m quite sure near the end, or at the end of the movie, the group battle the king’s men outside the castle, defeats them, and it show’s the main guy ready to go into the castle to kill the king. I apologize for all the parentheses and run-on sentences, I typed it up as my brain remembered things."}

{"query_id": "735", "query": "Loved based story between a married couple .\n Okay, I don’t remember how this movie starts off but I remember the main events that happened. It is a movie and I’m pretty sure I seen it in around 2010-2013 but I’m not sure. So pretty much this is a love story of complications between this married couple, the husband is the one messing up and the wife is the one who keeps putting up with it. He has an addiction to porn, the wife finds out and I think it really upset her. So the husband goes to his dad for advice, to figure how to fight for someone who doesn’t love you anymore. The dad and mom are very Christian. The dad gives his son the idea of a book of I think 100 things to try and by the end of the book, he should win his wife’s love back. (That’s not an accurate count.) well he does it, surprises her with flowers, I think some breakfast and tries to take her out to dinner. By the end of the movie, he wins his wife and conquers his problem. At the end of the movie his father tells him that him and his mom had gone through the same thing, one lost love for the other and the other fought for the love back. The plot twist was that, even though the father was giving his son the advice he needed as if he had done the same thing, he actually tells his son that [he] had been the one to lose love for his mother and his mother was the one who had fought to get it back. Then the son goes back into his house where his mother and wife were, crying and apologized and hugged his mom. I believe it was because he had been avoiding her and didn’t want anything to do with her assuming that she had put his through what he had gone. But that might not be correct. I hope that’s enough to the answer of the title of this movie, I remember it and I’ve been trying 1 year to find it and figure it out but I can’t. If you know it or have any possible ideas that will lead me to it, let me know please. Thank you in advanced!"}

She would dance in front of them. The story was a former female occupant had died in the house under suspicious circumstances, maybe she committed suicide or something. But the mirrors were haunted and the ghost arose and fought with the woman. Her husband came to help and tried to beat the ghost with a metal rod, a fire poker. Of course, the solid object went through the ghost and he actually beat his wife to death. Despondent , he thought that he saw his wife dancing in front of a window beckoning to him and he jumped through the window to his death.

There’s a tiny chance I missed it but it’s more likely I have the wrong movie. The movie (or possibly TV show episode) is definitely in English and in color and came out between 1995 and 2015 (more likely before 2010). The scene I see has 2 con artists /criminals working together (I think there is actually a large group but this scene focuses on 2). They are in 2 separate lines at airport security. They both have fake passports/identities and they are dressed in character. There characters are very different – while perhaps incorrect, I am picturing Bernie Mac in traditional South African attire and Eddie Jemison as a Rabbi or something. They both get to the front of their security lines and realise they have switched passports so Bernie Mac has to pretend to be a rabbi in his South African attire and Eddie Jemison takes off his yamaka and pretends to be South African. The security agent with Eddie happens to speak the South African language and the crew of con artists get really nervous as they watch Eddie wondering how he’s going to convince the security agent. After a pause, Eddie responds perfectly in the South African language and suprises everyone. They both make it through the security line safely.   Again, I may have the actors and fake identities wrong, but the the concept is definitely correct, and hopefully some of my memory is correct and will spark something in one of your minds! I’ve spent HOURS today searching for this so I will be REALLY thankful to anyone who can help!"}

The movie was in French but may have been an English one. What I saw was a kind of sect in white and the supposed guru trying to talk in front of them but could not say a word as the sect started applauding as soon as he opened the mouth. There was a kind of red eye which I suppose a kind of god of the sect. Then it seems that the guru was chosen to be sacrificed but not explicitly (led to a place with smoke). All this happens inside a building without windows. Then it is the final scene in front of Westminster Abbay or Big Ben in London with a dwarf dancing and jumping for no reason and it ends there.

From that point she is pregnant and soon gives birth to her daughter named Candy/Candi. The movie continues to show that the lady is miserable and wants to be a icon or famous or a model.

This guy was a real pioneer, founding a massive company that pretty much dominated the oil market back in the day. I remember reading that at one point, his company controlled almost all the oil in the United States. But then, there was some big legal drama, and the government stepped in and broke up his company because it was just too powerful.  After he stepped back from running his business, he became really into philanthropy. He poured a ton of his fortune into various causes, especially education and healthcare. I think he even helped start a couple of major universities. His wife was also really supportive of his charitable efforts, and together they made a huge impact on society.  I remember hearing that he was one of the richest people ever, maybe even the first billionaire in the country. His wealth was so immense that it was a significant chunk of the national economy at the time. Despite his immense fortune, he was known for being quite frugal in his personal life.

They had these viewfinders that let you zoom in on different landmarks, and there was even a glass cube that extended out from the building, giving you the feeling of floating above the city. It was both thrilling and a bit nerve-wracking.  I also remember there being a restaurant and a bar on an even higher floor, maybe the 89th? The atmosphere was quite elegant, and it felt like a place where you could celebrate something special.

One of the investigators was this no-nonsense, by-the-book type from up north, while the other had a more laid-back, local vibe, almost like he knew the area too well.  The town was super hostile, like everyone had something to hide, and there was this constant tension in the air. The local authorities were definitely not helpful; they were almost like part of the problem. There was a scene where a house gets firebombed, and it was so chaotic and terrifying. I remember feeling the heat and the panic of that moment.  One of the most striking parts was this relationship that developed between the laid-back investigator and a local woman. She was in a really tough spot, and her husband was involved in some really dark stuff. I think she eventually broke down and revealed some crucial information, but it came at a huge personal cost.  The ending was bittersweet. They managed to bring some of the bad guys to justice, but it felt like a hollow victory because the local system was still so corrupt.

They might be the youngest to take on this role, too, which is pretty impressive.  Before this big role, they were involved in politics at a regional level, somewhere in the eastern part of the country, I think. They served as a governor for a state that's known for its rich tribal culture. I remember reading about how they were in office for quite a long time, longer than most of their predecessors.

They also held various ministerial positions in their home state, dealing with commerce and transportation, if I recall correctly.

The main actor reminds me (several years on now) of Cary Grant or a young Michael Caine but I don't see anything in their IMDB that fits the scene I remember. The movie is about a cat burglar (main character) who gets into some trouble and has to either prove his innocence or do a job for someone else, pretty standard fare.  Not sure of the main plot beyond that.  What I do remember is that the movie somewhat starts off with him pilfering the apartment or hotel room of a wealthy older lady who is in the bath at the time while her husband is still downstairs entertaining.  I believe she catches him and won't let him go until she's had her fun (I'm not 100% sure about that).  Eventually he does make it out of there and back to his (or his lover's) place.  She's fairly young and a dancer so when she arrives complaining of aching feet, he rubs them for awhile before the two turn it up.  Either she complains about him needing to retire or doesn't know anything about it, I'm leaning towards the latter. I can say it's not Gambit or To Catch a Thief as neither has that scene.  Ideas?"}

At some point, there's a fire, and I remember the kids trying to save some younger children trapped inside. It was pretty intense.  The ending was really emotional. One of the main characters, who was kind of the heart of the group, doesn't make it. And another guy, who was really close to him, takes it really hard and does something tragic. The whole story is told from the perspective of this younger kid who's trying to make sense of everything that happened.

Anyway, she has this really overbearing and super religious mom who's kind of nuts. The mom thinks normal things are sinful, and she punishes her daughter in some pretty extreme ways.  The girl has a really rough time at school. There's this one scene that sticks out where she gets her first period in the school shower, and everyone starts making fun of her. Someone records it and uploads it online, which makes things even worse. The main bully, a girl with a mean streak, is particularly nasty and keeps tormenting her.  Things take a turn when the shy girl starts discovering she has these strange powers. She can move things with her mind, and it seems to get stronger the more upset she gets. There's this one girl who feels bad about the bullying and tries to make it up to her by getting her boyfriend to take the shy girl to prom. But of course, the bullies have to ruin it. They set up this elaborate prank involving a bucket of something gross, and it all goes down at prom night.  The prom scene is intense. The shy girl gets crowned prom queen, but then the prank happens, and she just loses it. Her powers go haywire, and there's chaos everywhere. I remember the gym or hall where the prom was held ends up in ruins, and a lot of people don't make it out. There's a scene where she goes home, and her mom thinks she's possessed or something, and it gets really dark.  In the end, there's this eerie scene at a graveyard with a headstone that cracks open, and it leaves you wondering if she's really gone. Does anyone have any idea what movie this could be? It's driving me nuts!"}
{"query_id": "2111", "query": "I remember this guy from a while back, kind of a big deal in football, but his story was more than just sports. He had a rough start, something about growing up in a tough neighborhood, maybe somewhere in the South? His family situation was pretty messy, with his mom struggling with some serious issues and his dad not really being around much. I think he bounced around a lot as a kid, like from one place to another, and had a hard time in school.  But then, there was this turning point. He ended up at a private school, and that's where things started to change. There were these coaches who really saw something in him, and he got into football big time. His grades were a mess at first, but he had some help from this family that kind of took him in. They weren't his real family, but they helped him get his act together. I think they even became his legal guardians or something like that.  He went on to play college football and got some big-time recognition. I remember he got drafted pretty high in the NFL and played for a few teams. One of them won a big championship while he was there. There was also a book and a movie about his life, which made his story pretty famous. But I heard recently that he had some legal issues with that family, something about not being adopted for real and them making money off his story.  Does anyone know who I'm talking about? It's driving me nuts trying to remember his name!"}

I'm not sure if it was a story from a series like  tales from the crypt ,  the hitchhiker,  the creepshow, or just a random thriller. The scenes I remember was a few young adults or older teenagers end up at this home with a very odd family that pretends their corpse daughter is still alive and they want these visitors to play with her. And one point one female visitor is on a cliff or ridge trying to flee from one of the crazy men and he accidentally kills her (head trauma) then he rips her shirt open to see her breasts. When he goes back to his crazy family they knew what he had done so the whip him while saying the Lord's prayer. It was so weird and I only seen it as a child. I'd like to research it."}

There was a scene where a woman was pinning a girl down in a full mount and holding down her arms. They're in the backyard of a house and it's brightly lit from the lights and the pools lanterns. Then a closeupof the woman's chest shows something crawling up from the inside. From her mouth, a centipede-looking thing comes out of her mouth and she tries to pass it into the girl's mouth. Two people then run out, a girl (mother? sister? cousin? friend?) and a guy. They knock her into the pool and the guy chucks a propane tank in, too. He shoots the tank with a gun and it explodes, killing her. There was also an earlier scene in which someone was pointing a gun at the woman and she dared them to shoot her. When they shot her in the head, she just leaned back and raised her head back up with a new bullet wound."}

He's got this larger-than-life personality and is known for his wild stories and antics. I think he's from Florida, maybe St. Petersburg? Anyway, he's been around for a while, and I first heard about him because of some magazine article that painted him as this legendary party animal at a big university. I think the article even inspired a movie about a college party legend, but I can't recall the title.  He's done a bunch of TV shows, one where he did all these crazy stunts and challenges, and another where he traveled around doing adventurous stuff. I remember one show where he was always trying to conquer his fears or something like that. He's also got a few podcasts, one with another comedian where they just riff on all sorts of topics, and another where he dives into his internet tabs or something. Oh, and he's got this cooking show where he's always making a mess in the kitchen.  His stand-up comedy is pretty unique because he usually performs shirtless, which is kind of his trademark. He's got this one famous story about a wild adventure in Russia involving some shady characters and a train heist, and it's so outrageous that it's become a big part of his act. He's also put out several comedy specials, and I think a couple of them are on Netflix.  He's married with two daughters, and I think his wife's name is LeeAnn. They seem to have a pretty fun family dynamic from what I've seen. I just can't seem to pin down his name right now. Does anyone know who I'm talking about?"}

{"query_id": "2127", "query": "I remember visiting this incredibly ancient place in Italy, but the name is slipping my mind. It's one of those spots that feels like stepping back in time, almost like you're in a different era altogether. The entire area is carved out of rock, and the houses seem to be stacked on top of each other in the most intricate way. I think the rock was called something like tufo or tufa? The streets were more like pathways that wound around and over the buildings, creating this maze-like structure that was both fascinating and a bit disorienting.  I recall walking through these narrow alleys, with the walls towering on either side, and every so often, you'd come across a small courtyard or an ancient church carved into the rock. There was this one spot where you could look out over a ravine, and the view was just breathtaking. I think there was a river at the bottom, maybe called something like Gravina? The whole place had this almost mystical vibe, like it had been frozen in time.  I remember hearing that people used to live there in pretty harsh conditions until the government stepped in and moved most of them out in the mid-20th century. But now, it's become quite the tourist spot, with charming little cafes, boutique hotels, and even some pubs. It's amazing how it's transformed from a place of poverty to a vibrant cultural hub.  I also have this vague memory of the place being featured in a few movies because it looks so much like ancient Jerusalem. And there was something about it being a UNESCO site, which makes sense given how unique and historic it is. Does anyone know the name of this place? It's been bugging me for days!"}
{"query_id": "2128", "query": "I keep thinking about this actress who had a pretty diverse career, bouncing between TV hosting and acting. She started out on some kind of tech or gaming show, I think it was around the mid-2000s. It was one of those shows where they talked about video games and gadgets, and she was really charismatic and funny. I remember she did some pretty wild stunts and skits on that show.  Later on, she made a shift to more serious stuff and ended up on a satirical news show. It was around the early 2010s, and she played a correspondent, delivering these witty and sharp segments. I think she was only on that show for a short while, but she left a strong impression.  Then, she landed a role in a political drama series on HBO. She played this super smart and confident financial analyst or something like that. Her character was really intense and had some great monologues. This show was on for a few seasons, and she was definitely one of the standout characters.  I also recall her being in a few movies. One was about male strippers, directed by a well-known filmmaker. She had a pretty memorable role in that one. She also played a mutant with some kind of psychic blade powers in a superhero movie. And there was this horror-action flick where she was part of a team hunting down an alien creature.  Her background is quite interesting too. She has a mixed heritage, with roots in Asia and Europe. I think her mom had a pretty tough journey coming to the U.S. as a refugee. She moved around a lot as a kid because of her stepdad's military career, but they eventually settled in the Midwest. She studied journalism in college, which might explain her knack for delivering lines with such conviction.  She's also been quite vocal about social issues, especially around animal rights and anti-Asian sentiment. I vaguely remember her being involved in some high-profile movements and speaking out against some big names in Hollywood.  In her personal life, she dated a famous football player for a few years and is now with a comedian. They have a kid together, and I think she recently shared some pretty tough news about her health.  Does anyone know who I'm talking about? It's driving me nuts trying to remember her name!"}
{"query_id": "2134", "query": "There's this place that's been on my mind lately, and I can't quite put my finger on its name. It's this grand, white stone structure, kind of like a giant doorway, but it's not a building you can enter. I remember it being in a park, a pretty popular one in a bustling city. The structure itself is quite tall, maybe around 70 or 80 feet, and it has these intricate carvings and statues on it. I think it was built to honor some important historical figure, maybe a president or a military leader, but I'm not entirely sure.  I remember walking through this park with some friends, and we were all struck by how majestic and almost ancient this archway felt, even though it's not really ancient. It kind of reminded me of those old Roman arches you see in history books. There were these large stars carved into it, and I think there were some smaller stars too, but my memory is a bit fuzzy on the details.  One thing that really stood out was the statues on either side of the arch. They seemed to represent different virtues or ideals, like bravery or wisdom. I think one of the statues was of the historical figure the arch commemorates, but again, I'm not entirely sure. The whole place had this mix of grandeur and a bit of wear and tear, like it had seen a lot over the years. I remember hearing that it had been cleaned up and restored at some point, maybe in the early 2000s.  Does anyone know what I'm talking about? It's been bugging me, and I'd love to hear if anyone else has memories of this place or knows its name."}
{"query_id": "2139", "query": "I remember visiting this towering structure in the heart of a bustling city, somewhere in Southeast Asia. It was this massive, gleaming skyscraper that seemed to pierce the sky, almost like it was trying to touch the clouds. The building had this futuristic vibe, with sleek lines and a spire that made it look like something out of a sci-fi movie. I think it was the tallest thing around for miles, and it had this incredible observation deck where you could see the entire city sprawled out below you.  I was with a couple of friends, and we had just come from a nearby historic stadium, which I think had something to do with independence or freedom. There was also this charming old street market nearby, filled with the aroma of street food and the chatter of vendors. The whole area felt like a blend of the old and the new, with this towering structure standing as a testament to modern engineering amidst the historical surroundings.  The skyscraper itself was part of a larger complex, with offices, hotels, and even a shopping mall. I remember we spent some time wandering through a beautifully landscaped park that surrounded the building. It was a mix of urban and green spaces, creating a serene escape from the city's hustle and bustle.  One thing that stood out was the building's commitment to sustainability. I heard it was the first in the country to achieve some kind of triple platinum rating for being eco-friendly. The whole experience was surreal, almost like stepping into the future while still being rooted in the past.  Does anyone know which place I'm talking about? It's been bugging me for a while, and I'd love to revisit those memories. Any guesses?"}
{"query_id": "2155", "query": "weird movie about smugglers looking for teenage boy .\n So we saw this movie a few years ago.  It was pretty weird , but lately I keep thinking about it. This is what I remember.  Foreign film (french?).  I think it might have been silent (or very little spoken dialogue). Mother, father, young teenage girl.  Mother is a pianist.  Wealthy family.  They move from the city to somewhere remote. There is some kind of accident or crash or drug deal gone wrong that happens near their house.  One survivor (the only one?) of the mayhem is a young teenage boy who was shot.  The girl hides him in one of the family's outbuildngs, and tends to his serious abdominal/intestinal wounds.  Turns out the bad guys were smuggling stuff inside his body (I think drugs) and naturally they are going to come looking for him.  The boy slowly begins to mend.  The bad guys hang around the family property and shoot the family's dog.  The girl takes the boy to a school function or dance.  For camouflage, he is dressed as a girl.  While there, his abdominal wounds start to bleed profusely; the blood is very visible on the white dress he is wearing, and somehow the nuns believe he has just reached puberty.  Odd, since he is bleeding from the abdomen. The boy and girl fall in love.  The bad guys are still looking for him/them.  The boy and girl leave her home for the old empty house in the city.  The bad guy(s) find them in the house.  They die together, shot, maybe in the house but I keep picturing another location.  Empty, sad, depressing, lonely, weird and I still don't know what the point is. Any one out there seen this thing? THANKS!!"}

They have three kids, and the kids start seeing the mom as this super strict, no-fun person.   Anyway, the parents decide to do this thing where they have to say yes to everything the kids ask for one whole day. I remember them doing all sorts of crazy stuff like dressing up in weird outfits and eating this gigantic ice cream sundae. There's also this scene where they go through a car wash with the windows down, which was hilarious and chaotic.  One of the kids, the older daughter, wants to go to some music festival, and there's a bit of drama around that. I think the parents end up getting into trouble at an amusement park, and there's a big confrontation. The kids sneak off somewhere, and there's a moment where the daughter feels really let down by her friend, but then she and her mom have this heart-to-heart moment at the festival.  The day ends with the family camping out in their backyard, but then something crazy happens with a foam bomb or something, and it starts filling the house.

One of those movies had him holding a boombox over his head in a really iconic scene, if that rings any bells.  He also did some more serious stuff later on, like this one film where he was a hitman going back to his high school reunion. That one was a mix of dark comedy and action, and it was pretty unique for its time. I remember he was also in a movie with a lot of famous faces, something about a plane full of convicts, and he played a good guy trying to sort out the mess.  His family is kind of a big deal too, I think. He has a sister who's also an actress, and they might have even been in a movie together at some point.

Anyway, he wasn't the lead singer in that group, but he played guitar and maybe drums too.  Later on, he started his own project, which had this really catchy song about getting better.

I remember one of his collaborations was with a young female artist who had a big hit about shaking things off.  He's won a bunch of awards, including some big ones for producing, and I think he might have even won something three years in a row recently.

The main character was this really awkward guy who was obsessed with becoming a famous comedian. He had this kind of desperate, almost creepy vibe, but you couldn't help but feel a bit sorry for him.  He idolized this big-time talk show host, who was like the epitome of success in the comedy world. I remember there was a scene where the main guy somehow managed to meet his idol, but things didn't go as planned. The host was pretty dismissive, and it just fueled the main guy's obsession even more.  Things got really wild when the main guy decided to take some drastic measures. I think he ended up kidnapping the talk show host or something? It was all part of this crazy plan to get his big break on TV. There was this intense moment where he finally got to perform his comedy routine, and the audience was laughing, but it was hard to tell if they were in on the joke or just thought it was part of the act.  I also vaguely remember a line about it being better to be a king for a night than something else, which really stuck with me.

I also recall him doing some quirky, offbeat comedies with another actor who's known for his comedic roles. They had this great chemistry, and one of their movies involved a lot of, let's say, herbal humor. I think they even did an animated film together that was pretty raunchy.  He's also done some serious roles. There was this one movie where he played a real-life person who got stuck in a dire situation and had to make a drastic decision to survive. That performance was really gripping, and I think he got some award buzz for it.  On TV, he was in this short-lived but beloved show about high school misfits.

{"query_id": "2249", "query": "So, there's this movie I watched ages ago, and it's been bugging me because I can't remember the name. It was one of those adventure flicks where a group of people ends up on this wild underground journey. I think it started with a guy who was some kind of scientist or professor, and he had this young relative with him, maybe a nephew? They were looking for his missing brother, who had left behind some cryptic notes in an old book. I think the book might have been by a famous author, like one of those classic adventure novels.  Anyway, they end up traveling to some remote place, possibly in Europe, and meet a woman who joins them on their quest. I remember they had to deal with some crazy weather, like a lightning storm, which somehow forced them into a cave. The cave then collapses, trapping them and sending them deeper underground. They find all sorts of weird stuff down there, like an abandoned mine and even some ancient remains that might have been the missing brother.  The deeper they go, the more bizarre things get. There was this scene where they had to cross an underground ocean on a makeshift raft, and at some point, they encounter a giant dinosaur, maybe a T-Rex? The whole thing was pretty intense, and they had to figure out how to get back to the surface before something catastrophic happened. I think they eventually escape through some kind of natural geyser that shoots them out of a volcano.  Does anyone have any idea what movie this could be? It's driving me nuts!"}

I remember he had this knack for writing songs that really captured the spirit of the era  you know, those protest anthems that everyone seemed to be singing along to. His voice was kinda nasally, not what you'd call traditionally beautiful, but it had this raw, genuine quality that made his lyrics hit harder.  I think he started off with a very folksy vibe, maybe inspired by some older legends of the genre. His early stuff had that acoustic, storytelling feel, but then he made this huge shift to electric guitar, which I remember caused quite a stir among his fans. Some people were really upset about it, but others thought it was groundbreaking.   There was also a period where he seemed to disappear from the public eye for a bit  I think it was after some kind of accident? When he came back, his music had this different flavor, more country or something. And then, later on, he even dabbled in gospel music for a while, which was another surprising turn.  He was part of this supergroup at one point, with a bunch of other famous musicians. And I think he won some really prestigious awards later in his career, maybe even something literary, which is pretty unusual for a musician. His influence is still felt today, and he's known for constantly touring, like he never really stopped performing.  Does anyone know who I'm talking about? It's driving me nuts!"}

I remember he was part of a band with his brothers, and they had this huge moment on a popular kids' TV channel. They were in a couple of musical movies, and I think they even had their own show for a while. The band had a few big hits, one of which was something about being on fire or burning up, if that makes sense.  After the band took a break, he went solo and had this catchy song about being envious or something along those lines. He also did some acting, and I distinctly remember him being in a jungle adventure movie with a bunch of other big names. More recently, he was a coach on one of those singing competition shows.   He's also done some interesting stuff outside of music and acting, like launching a drink brand and getting involved in fashion. I think he's been pretty active in charity work too, especially related to a health condition he has had since he was a teenager.  Does anyone know who I'm talking about?

There was this serene little garden area, kind of sunken below street level, with these intriguing rock formations that felt almost like a hidden retreat amidst the chaos of the city. I think it might have had some Japanese influence, but my memory is a bit fuzzy on that. I remember spending some time there, just soaking in the tranquility while the city buzzed above.  The building itself had this modern, almost futuristic vibe, with these dark, sleek lines and a very minimalist design. I think it was designed by some famous architect or firm, maybe the same folks who did another iconic building in Chicago? Not entirely sure, though.  I also remember hearing something about it being a major hub for some big financial institution back in the day, and there was talk of it being renovated or repurposed in recent years. The name of the place changed at some point, which makes it even harder to pin down.   Does anyone else recall this place?

There was this tough woman, maybe a firefighter or something, who had her own demons to deal with. She ends up helping the boy navigate through the wilderness.  The bad guys were these relentless assassins who were after the boy for some reason, I think it had to do with his dad uncovering some dangerous secrets. They even set a massive forest fire to flush him out, which added to the chaos. There was this one scene where the woman and the boy were caught in a lightning storm, and it knocked out their communication gear, making things even more desperate.  I also remember a subplot involving a deputy sheriff and his pregnant wife, who got dragged into the mess. The wife was pretty badass, fighting back against the assassins. The climax had this intense showdown in the middle of the forest fire, with the woman and the boy barely making it out alive. In the end, they were rescued, and the boy was ready to reveal his dad's secrets to the world, with the woman promising to stick by his side.  Does anyone know what movie this might be?

He moved out there because he was sick and the mountain air supposedly helped him get better.   The hotel itself had this sprawling, almost colonial feel to it, with white columns and wide verandas. I remember the views being absolutely breathtaking  you could see this huge lake and these towering peaks in the distance. There was something almost eerie about the place, though. I think it might have been the inspiration for some famous horror story or movie. The halls were long and quiet, and there were all these stories about ghost sightings and strange occurrences.  I was there with my family, and we stayed in one of the older rooms. The bed was this massive, ornate thing, and the room had these old-fashioned light fixtures that gave off this soft, golden glow. There was a restaurant downstairs that served the most amazing food, and I think there was even a spa.   One night, we took a tour that talked about the history of the place, and it was fascinating but also a bit creepy. They mentioned something about the original owner's health improving dramatically after he moved there, and how the hotel played a big role in developing the surrounding area into a resort town.

One of his films, I think, was about a warrior prince or something, and it had these grand battle scenes and a storyline that spanned generations. It was so popular that it even got a sequel, which broke all sorts of box office records.  I think he started his career with some smaller, more dramatic roles before moving on to these big action-packed films. He's often referred to with a nickname that implies he's a bit of a maverick or a rebel, if that helps. I remember reading somewhere that he's one of the highest-paid actors in his industry and has been featured in some celebrity lists for years.  Oh, and there was something about him having a wax statue in a famous museum, which is pretty rare for actors from his region. He's also done some humanitarian work, especially during the pandemic, making significant donations and supporting various causes.  I recall a few of his other movies being quite popular too, like one where he played a sort of Robin Hood character, and another where he was involved in some intense family drama.

He did a lot of different characters, and his impressions were pretty spot-on. I think he played a political figure or two, and he had this knack for quirky, offbeat humor.  He also had this show with a female co-star, something about a quirky city in the Pacific Northwest. It was full of these oddball characters and satirical takes on hipster culture. I think the show was on some niche cable network, not one of the big ones.   Besides acting, he's really into music. I remember seeing him play drums on a late-night talk show, and I think he was part of the house band. He's got this punk rock background, and I vaguely recall he was in a band that had a pretty underground following.  His personal life is kind of a blur, but I think he's been married a couple of times, and he dated an actress who's known for her roles in indie films and TV shows.

He even had a reality TV show at one point, showing his life with his family. I remember watching it and thinking how wild his life seemed.  There was also this really tragic event he went through  a plane crash, if I'm not mistaken. It was all over the news, and it was a miracle he survived.

I was there with a group of friends, and we were all struck by the sheer size of the building. It felt like stepping into a different era. There was this sense of reverence, almost like being in a cathedral, but it wasn't a church. Inside, it was quite spacious, with high ceilings and intricate details that made you want to look up and just take it all in.  I vaguely recall reading something about a famous leader and his wife being laid to rest there. The story behind it was quite touching, involving a lot of effort and dedication from the community to honor this person's legacy. There were talks of a statue that was supposed to be outside, but I don't remember seeing it. Maybe it was never completed?  The place had seen better days, though. There were signs of wear and tear, and I think there was some kind of restoration effort going on at the time.

There was a lot of buzz because this new place is supposed to open just in time for a major sports season. I think it's also going to be used for some big international sports event in a few years.   There were some legal hiccups along the way, with some local groups and a nearby venue causing a bit of a stir. I think the owner of the basketball team ended up buying out the nearby venue to smooth things over. This new place is supposed to have a ton of seats, a fancy practice area, and even a medical clinic. I remember something about a crazy amount of restrooms too, which is kind of funny but practical.  One of the coolest things I heard about was this double-sided screen or board that's supposed to be a big deal. They're also planning to host all sorts of events, not just basketball games.

One of her early roles was in a scandalous movie about a teacher-student relationship, and she also had a part in a film about two sisters competing for the affection of a king. She's got this unique look, kind of elfin, and she often plays quirky or intense characters. I think she was in a movie with musketeers and another one with a dark knight, but not the main roles, more like supporting characters that really stood out.  In recent years, she's been in a popular comedy series about an American coach in England and a crime drama set in the Midwest. She's been nominated for some big awards, maybe even won a few. I remember reading about her winning something that recognized her as a rising star a while back. She's also been in some music videos and won an award at a film festival in Prague for a role in an indie film about mental health.

He played college ball at one of those big southern schools, the kind that's always in the national championship conversation. I think he won some big awards and even led his team to a title early on. There was this one game where he came in and just lit it up, like a real underdog story. But then, he had some injury issues, something serious with his hip, I believe, and people were worried if he'd ever play again.  Despite that, he got picked pretty high in the draft by a team that's known for its aquatic mascot. His rookie year was kind of a mixed bag, sometimes starting, sometimes not. But he really started to shine a couple of years in, leading the league in some important stats and even making it to the Pro Bowl.  Off the field, he's really into giving back, has some foundation for kids or something. And I think he's into martial arts to stay in shape and avoid injuries.

I believe the colours of the room were very dim and dull. There is a possibility that it may have been done in stop-motion, although I am fairly certain it was not claymation.

His journey takes him to some really unexpected places, like Africa, where he learns about this boy with special powers to fight an evil entity. The girl, who has some psychic abilities, ends up helping another kid with some condition, which shocks the doctors.  One scene that stands out is when they use this bizarre machine to sync their minds or something. It was all very trippy and unsettling. The climax happens in this old house, which I think was significant in the first movie. There's this intense showdown with the evil force, and the priest has to resist some kind of temptation.

The rich guy's behavior becomes more and more erratic, and he starts pushing the younger brother into some unhealthy habits, like drugs. The younger brother's performance starts to suffer, and you can see him spiraling downwards.  Eventually, the older brother gets involved too, moving his family to be closer to the team. But the relationship between the rich guy and the brothers just keeps getting worse. There's this really tense atmosphere, and you can feel things are heading towards a bad ending.

Everything was over-the-top luxurious, from the indoor tropical forest to the elaborate shows they hosted. There was this one magic duo, famous for their white tigers, who performed there for years. Their show was a huge draw.  I also vaguely recall that the place went through some big changes recently. I heard something about a new company taking over and planning a major renovation, even adding a new tower shaped like a guitar or something. It's strange to think about how much it's changed since I was there.  Does anyone know the name of this place? It's driving me crazy trying to remember!"}

Probably a fantasy or horror film from the 80s-90s. I won't be surprised if it's some episode from a tales from the crypt-like series. A guy receives or finds a watch (clock) or some device with arrows on it that opens gates or portals or doors.  The arrows point to the side where that portal should open. It might be not the central item of the film. There might be a girl that he tries to save (what a surprise). Perhaps she was lost in that portal. There might be a museum present in one of the scenes (might be another film). Super vague, yes, I know. But it stuck in my memory and I still didn't manage to find that film. Thanks."}

Her character was always in these intense situations, fixing scandals and whatnot, and she had this really commanding presence.  I also remember her playing a significant role in a movie about a famous musicianmaybe it was a biopic? She was amazing in that too. And there was another film where she was involved in some kind of historical conflict, possibly set in Africa. Her performances are always so compelling and nuanced.  She's done some work on streaming platforms too, I think. There was a show where she played a character involved in a lot of family drama, and it was based on a popular book. I'm pretty sure she's been nominated for several awards, maybe even won a few. She's also known for her activism, particularly around voting rights and social justice issues.  I vaguely recall she has a background in anthropology or sociology, and she might have gone to a university in D.C.

The prize was something like a big cash reward, maybe $10,000 or something.  The characters were pretty diverse  I remember there was a young woman who was really smart, maybe a student? And there was this rich guy who seemed kind of arrogant. There was also a guy who worked in a store, a truck driver, a war veteran, and someone who was really into these kinds of games. They all meet up in this ordinary-looking office building, but things get intense really fast.  The rooms they had to escape from were crazy dangerous. The first one was like a giant oven, and then there was this cabin that turned into a freezing nightmare. One of the guys, I think he was the game enthusiast, didn't make it out of the icy room. Another room was like an upside-down bar, and someone fell to their death there. There was also a hospital room filling with gas, and it got really intense with betrayals and shocking moments.  The survivors eventually confront this guy who explains that the whole thing was some sick game for rich people to bet on. They manage to escape, but when they go back with the authorities, everything is gone, like it never happened. The ending hinted that their ordeal wasn't over, with some new game being set up.

It was one of those intense thrillers that left a lasting impression, but the name just won't come to me. The plot revolved around this disgraced law enforcement officer, a woman who was trying to redeem herself after a failed operation. She gets drawn back into the hunt for this elusive and highly intelligent criminal who had a penchant for, well, let's just say, unconventional culinary habits.  There was this wealthy, sinister guy who was horribly disfigured and paralyzed, and he had this elaborate plan to capture and exact revenge on the criminal. He used his influence to get the officer involved, hoping it would lure the criminal out of hiding. I vividly remember a scene set in a beautiful European city where a local cop recognizes the criminal and tries to catch him for a huge bounty. Things go sideways, and the local cop meets a gruesome end.  Another part that stuck with me involved a bunch of wild animals, maybe boars or something, that were supposed to devour the criminal. But in a twist, the animals end up attacking the bad guys instead. The climax was super intense, with the officer getting injured and the criminal performing some kind of twisted surgery on another character. The ending was bizarre and unsettling, with the criminal escaping in a rather dramatic fashion.  Does anyone have any idea what movie this might be? It's been bugging me for days!"}

The plot revolved around this young woman who sold flowers on the streets, and she had a really thick accent. There was this older guy, a bit of a know-it-all, who made a bet with his friend that he could teach her to speak like a high-society lady.   I think there was a scene where they were at a horse race, and she had to mingle with the upper class, trying to fit in. She ended up doing really well, but the guy who taught her didn't give her much credit, which made her pretty upset. There was also a fancy ball where she dazzled everyone with her new accent and manners.   I remember feeling a mix of emotions because she worked so hard to change, but in the end, she felt out of place in both her old and new worlds. The movie had this bittersweet ending where she returned to the guy's house, and he asked her something mundane, like about his slippers, which somehow felt really significant.

Anyway, she played this super smart and driven character, always solving puzzles and getting into all sorts of trouble.  I remember she started acting really young, like in some movie her dad directed. Her dad was pretty famous in the TV world, I think he created a show about time travel or something. She also had a small role in a movie with twins who were trying to set their dad up with someone.   She has this really interesting background, a mix of different cultures, and she went to some fancy school where she was top of her class. Later, she went to a couple of different colleges, one of them being really artsy, before finishing at a big university in California.  I also recall she married an actor from a legal drama series, and they have a couple of kids. She's been pretty open about her struggles with some personal issues, which makes her even more relatable.   She's done some indie films too, one where she played a writer, and another where she was in space or something. I think she was also in a movie about a woman who just disappears.

The guy on the phone tries to help her, but he's stuck in his office and can only communicate through calls. I think he talks to her young daughter at some point, and there's something about the kid's father having a violent history.  The tension kept building, and there was this heartbreaking twist involving the woman's mental state and her kids.

It was so gripping and emotional, especially when he reveals something dark about his past to try and stop her from doing something drastic.  Does anyone have any idea what this movie might be?

There was this one scene where they had a stage prop that was supposed to be this grand, ancient monument, but it ended up being ridiculously small. The band members were all childhood friends, and they had this long history of changing their band name and style. At one point, they were into this flower power vibe with a song that had something to do with flowers or peace, but then they shifted to heavy metal.  I also remember something about their drummers having a really bad luck streaklike, they kept dying in weird ways. One of the drummers even exploded on stage, if I recall correctly. The band's popularity was on the decline, and there were a lot of internal conflicts, especially when one of the band members' girlfriends joined the tour and started meddling in their decisions.  There was this bit about their album cover being controversial because it was just plain black, and it caused a lot of issues. Towards the end, one of the main guys left the band after some equipment failure, but then he came back with news that one of their songs was a hit in Japan.

The place had this aura of old-world charm mixed with a sense of modernity, probably because it had been renovated a few times over the years. I recall hearing stories about a famous book being written there, something that won a prestigious award. The family who lived there had a lot of kids, and I remember imagining the laughter and chaos that must have filled those halls.  There was also talk about a high-profile legal figure who lived there before it became associated with this well-known family. The house had these beautiful, expansive rooms, and I think there was a significant renovation in the mid-20th century that added to its grandeur.  I visited the area once, and the house stood out with its elegant brick facade and lush greenery. It felt like stepping back in time, yet there was a sense of ongoing life and history being made.

The whole structure was made of this sturdy, greyish stone, maybe granite? It felt like stepping back in time, into an era of kings and empires.  The courtyard was vast, with a long, colonnaded corridor that seemed to go on forever. There were shrines everywhere, each dedicated to different deities. I distinctly remember a huge statue of a bull, possibly Nandi, and several smaller shrines for other gods and goddesses. The main deity was a massive figure, a Shiva linga, if I recall correctly. There were also some stunning sculptures, including one of a dancing figure, which I think was Shiva in his Nataraja form.  The place had this incredible energy, a mix of serenity and grandeur. I remember the walls being adorned with intricate carvings and frescoes, though some parts seemed to have been added or renovated over the centuries. There was even a moat around it, which added to the fortress-like feel of the place.  I went there with a group of friends, and we spent hours just wandering around, soaking in the history and the artistry. The temple was bustling with activity, with pilgrims and tourists alike.

At some point, he tries to turn his life around and seeks help from this older, kind of grizzled trainer. The trainer was reluctant at first, maybe because of the boxer's reputation or his own past, but eventually, they start working together.

One part that really stuck with me was this intense scene with a SWAT team in a gunfight, and then there was this other bit where they showed someone getting executed in an electric chair. It was all very graphic and unsettling.  The narrator had this recurring dream that seemed to drive him to explore these morbid topics, and he kept questioning why people are so violent. There were also parts about war and some really creepy stuff involving a snake cult and cannibalism. I think there was even a segment about a plane crash and a failed parachute jump, which added to the overall eerie vibe.  Towards the end, the movie took a weird turn into the supernatural, with the narrator investigating a guy who thought his dead family was communicating with him. The final scenes were a strange mix of macabre and peaceful imagery, like showing a baby's birth right after all these horrific scenes. It left me feeling really uneasy but also fascinated.  Does anyone have any idea what this movie might be? It's been driving me nuts trying to remember!"}
{"query_id": "2523", "query": "I hope someone has some idea of this movie to help me .\n Ok, I would have first seen this movie back quite some time ago (1990's or before). American film, in color. I had thought this was a Tom Hanks film, but when I go through his IMDB, none of the titles/images brings it to mind, so I'm thinking in that I'm mistaken. So, what I do remember is that the main character during part of the film works as a volunteer chemical tester, being exposed to various chemical substances that among other things, destroys his sense of smell, and with it his sense of taste. He ends up working at jobs that most anyone would rather not do, since they are so unpleasant (I think one of those jobs was in a salt factory, as I feel I remember seeing him slipping and tumbling down a huge pile of some grainy/almost powdery stuff), and lives his life on the small wages he can make, and the disability checks he gets for the residual damages from the chemical exposures. I'm pretty sure it was a dark comedy, as it vacillated between the humor of the things he went through, and the dark, near empty life he led. Even touching on the fact that his limited finances weren't too bad, as without a sense of taste, he just ate the same meals every day, cause it was cheap and easy (spaghetti). I can't remember what else happens, just images of him in a test chamber getting flooded with various gasses/chemicals, and taking off his mask (if he even had one to begin with), and hacking/coughing/sneezing, being treated badly by bosses, and that scene of him trying to move across, or up that huge pile of near sandy stuff, slipping, tumbling and falling, and getting frustrated with it all I know, this is pretty vague, but I'm really hoping someone can help me find this one, as I'd like to check it out again, if for no better reason than to give it context, so that isn't the only parts I can recall about it Thanks for any help!"}
{"query_id": "2524", "query": "I remember watching this old-timey detective movie a while back, and it's been bugging me because I can't recall the name. It was set in this glamorous, almost noir-ish version of Los Angeles, maybe around the late '30s or so. The main character was this gritty private eye, kind of like the ones you see in those classic detective stories. He gets hired by this really elegant woman, probably an heiress or something, to find her missing lover. The lover was involved in the film industry, I think he worked with props or something like that.  Anyway, the detective finds out that the guy supposedly died in a pretty gruesome way, like getting run over or something, but then the woman claims she saw him alive in some border town. There was this whole thing with a fancy club where the detective tries to get info but ends up in more trouble. I remember a scene where he visits a grave and sees a mysterious woman mourning, but she runs off before he can talk to her.  There was also this subplot with a drug lord and some stolen drugs, and the detective gets mixed up in that mess too. At one point, he gets captured and has to fake being poisoned to escape. There was a lot of sneaking around and double-crossing, and I think the detective had a friend in the police force who helped him out.  The ending was pretty intense, with a showdown at some club and the detective finding out some dark truths. There was a fire, a betrayal, and the detective had to make a tough choice about whether to expose the truth or let it slide. The whole thing had this moody, atmospheric vibe, and the characters were all morally grey.  Does anyone have any idea what movie this might be? It's driving me nuts!"}
{"query_id": "2530", "query": "I remember visiting this really intriguing place in Japan a few years back. It was this massive structure with two towering buildings that seemed to touch the sky. The towers were connected at the top by these glass bridges, and I recall there being escalators that felt like they were floating in mid-air. It was such a surreal experience, almost like something out of a sci-fi movie.  The view from the top was absolutely breathtaking. There was this observatory, I think they called it something like a floating garden, where you could see the entire city sprawling out beneath you. The skyline was dotted with other tall buildings, but none quite as unique as this one. I remember the feeling of the wind up there, cool and refreshing, and the way the city lights twinkled as the sun set.  At the base of the building, there was this underground market that felt like stepping back in time. It had an old-world charm, with narrow alleys and vintage-style shops. There were also some lovely gardens with winding paths and little water features, perfect for a quiet stroll.  I stayed at a hotel nearby, which was super convenient because it was close to a couple of major train stations. I think one of the companies in the building was a car manufacturer, and there was also a consulate and some other big names.  Does anyone know what this place might be called? It's been bugging me for ages, and I'd love to go back someday. Any help would be appreciated!"}
{"query_id": "2540", "query": "I remember visiting this ancient, sacred place during a trip to a city that's been the heart of so many stories and histories. It's a massive stone wall, and people from all over the world come to pray there. The stones are huge and weathered, and some parts of the wall look like they've been there forever, while other sections seem like they were added later. I think it might have been a retaining wall for something very important, maybe a temple or a significant religious site.  The atmosphere was incredibly solemn, with people pressing their foreheads against the stones, slipping pieces of paper with prayers into the cracks. There was a sense of deep reverence and history, almost like you could feel the weight of centuries of devotion in the air. I remember there were different areas for men and women to pray, and it was always bustling with activity, from religious ceremonies to personal moments of reflection.  I also recall hearing that this place has seen many changes in control and access over the years, especially during various periods of conquest and rule. There were stories about it being a focal point for different faiths, and I think there was something about a prophet and a mystical journey involving a steed tied to the wall.  One of the most striking memories is the sound of prayers and chants filling the air, mingling with the rustle of paper and the murmur of voices. It felt like a place where the past and present were intertwined, where every stone had a story to tell.  Does anyone know the name of this place? It's been bugging me for a while, and I'd love to hear your thoughts or any similar experiences you might have had."}
{"query_id": "2558", "query": "I remember watching this old martial arts movie ages ago, and it's been bugging me because I can't recall the name. It was about this guy who was in the military, I think, and he had this intense training with a wise old master. The master had a son who passed away, and somehow this guy ended up being like a surrogate son or something. There was this whole backstory about him trying to steal a sword, but instead of getting in trouble, he got trained by the master.   The main plot revolved around this underground fighting tournament in some Asian city, maybe Hong Kong? The tournament was super secretive and illegal, and the fighters were from all over the world. The protagonist had to sneak away from his military duties to compete. He had this big, burly American friend who was also a fighter, and they had a local guide who helped them navigate the city and the tournament.  There was also a journalist, an American woman, who was trying to uncover the secrets of the tournament. She and the main guy had a bit of a thing going on, but he was really focused on competing. I remember a scene where his friend got badly beaten by this ruthless champion, who was like the big bad of the movie. The protagonist swore to avenge his friend and kept advancing through the rounds.  At some point, there were these two agents or officers chasing him around the city, trying to bring him back to his duties. There was a chase scene that was pretty intense, but he managed to evade them. In the final fight, the bad guy did something underhanded, like throwing powder in the protagonist's eyes to blind him. But the hero remembered his training and fought through it, eventually winning the tournament.  The ending had him saying goodbye to the journalist and his friend before heading back with the agents. Does anyone know what movie this could be? It's driving me crazy!"}
{"query_id": "2574", "query": "I'm trying to recall this one football figure, and it's driving me nuts. He was quite the chameleon on the field, playing in various positions, mostly midfield or forward, if I remember correctly. He had this incredible stamina and a bit of a fiery temperament. I think he played for two major Spanish clubs, and I want to say it was during the '90s and early 2000s. One of those clubs had a white kit, and the other had a blue and red one. He was quite successful, scoring over 100 goals and playing more than 500 games, I believe.  This guy also had a significant international career, representing Spain in multiple World Cups and a European Championship. After hanging up his boots, he transitioned into management. I remember he started with a B team of one of those big clubs and then moved on to manage in Italy and another Spanish team before returning to one of his former clubs. He led them to some major victories, including a treble and a double in consecutive seasons.  More recently, he took charge of the Spanish national team, leading them to the Euro 2020 semi-finals and a Nations League final. I think he stepped down after the 2022 World Cup. Now, he's managing a top French club and already won a few domestic trophies in his first season. His coaching style is quite flexible and direct, and he's considered one of the top managers of his time.  Does anyone know who I'm talking about? Any help would be appreciated!"}
{"query_id": "2578", "query": "There's this actress I've been trying to remember, and it's driving me nuts. She was one of those classic Hollywood stars, you know, from the era when movies had that black-and-white charm. I think she was really big in the 1940s and 50s. She had this sultry, almost mysterious vibe about her, and she was known for her striking looks and captivating performances.  I remember she was in this film noir that had a lot of tension and drama. I think it was about a heist or something, and her role was pretty pivotal. She had this way of drawing you in with just a look. I also recall she was in a movie set in Africa, where she played opposite a couple of big male stars of the time. There was a lot of talk about her performance in that one.  Her personal life was quite the rollercoaster too. She had a few high-profile marriages, and one of her husbands was a famous singer who was quite the heartthrob himself. They had a tumultuous relationship, but it seemed like there was a lot of passion there. She also had some interesting friendships with other big names, like a reclusive billionaire and a famous writer who loved adventure.  I think she was from the South, maybe from a small town, and she had a bit of an accent when she started out. There's something about her being discovered through a photograph, if I'm not mixing things up. Later in life, she moved to Europe and spent her final years there.  Does anyone have any idea who I might be thinking of? It's been bugging me, and I'd love to watch some of her old movies again."}
{"query_id": "2582", "query": "I remember this towering building somewhere in the heart of a bustling city, maybe near some famous hills or something. It was this really tall structure, way taller than anything else around it, which made it stand out like a sore thumb, but in a good way. I think it was built back in the 60s, and it had this sleek, modern vibe to it, like something out of a retro-futuristic movie. The architect was someone who studied under some big names in the mid-century modern scene, which probably explains the cool design.  I used to visit a friend who lived there, and I remember the place had this air of exclusivity. There was always someone at the front desk, and I think they had a gym and a pool, but I never used them. The building had this mix of old Hollywood glamour and modern luxury, and I swear I saw a few celebrities in the lobby a couple of times. My friend mentioned that some famous singer and a few actors had places there, but I can't recall their names.  The view from the higher floors was just breathtaking, especially at night when the city lights sparkled below. It felt like you were on top of the world. I think the building was converted from apartments to condos at some point, maybe in the 70s? It was originally developed by some real estate moguls, and I remember hearing about some crazy expensive sales in recent years, like someone buying two units for a ridiculous amount of money.  Does anyone know what I'm talking about? It's been bugging me for a while, and I'd love to get some help piecing this together."}

It was this intense thriller set in some dusty, almost desolate town. The main guy was this high-up executive, maybe in telecom or something, who somehow gets caught up in a whirlwind of chaos. I remember he was driving through this barren road, and then there's this convoy of shady characters led by this really menacing guy.   The town itself was in a state of turmoil, with a political rally that spirals into violence. There was this scene where a butcher gets killed, and it felt so raw and unsettling. The protagonist ends up helping this woman who was engaged to some local politician, and they go on the run together. They hide out at a friend's place, but things go south quickly, and they have to flee again.   There was a lot of tension, with car chases and close calls. At one point, they try to seek refuge in this old fort, but there's this whole fake news angle that complicates things. The climax was super intense, with a stabbing and a narrow escape. I think there was even a post-credits scene showing the main guy recovering and the woman running for some political position.  I watched it with a friend during a late-night movie marathon, and we were both on the edge of our seats the whole time. The atmosphere was so gripping, with a mix of fear and adrenaline.

There was something about a bombing, and he gets wrongly accused along with a few others. The whole thing was super tense, with a lot of courtroom drama and prison scenes.  The main guy's dad plays a big role too. I remember their relationship being really central to the story. The dad was this older, kind-hearted man who just wanted to help his son. There was a lot of emotional stuff between them, especially when they were both in prison. I think the dad might have died at some point, which was a really heartbreaking moment.  There was also this lawyer, a woman, who was really determined to prove their innocence. She digs up some crucial evidence that eventually helps clear their names. Oh, and there was this other guy in prison who actually confessed to the crime, but the authorities ignored it to cover up their mistakes.   The movie had this gritty, almost documentary-like feel to it, and the performances were really powerful. I remember feeling a mix of frustration and hope throughout the film.

He was quite the prodigy, scoring a ridiculous number of goals as a kid, something like 90 or 100, which is just insane for his age.  He joined one of the top clubs in Spain when he was around 11 or so, and quickly climbed the ranks. I think he made his professional debut not too long ago, maybe a couple of years back, and he's already being compared to some of the club's legends. His playing style is really dynamic  he's got this amazing ability to dribble through tight spaces and his vision on the field is just next level.  I remember hearing that he won some major awards recently, like one for being the best young player in Europe or something, and another that recognizes his overall talent. He also made his debut for the national team at a very young age, breaking some kind of record, and even scored his first goal in a major tournament.  There was something about him helping his team win a few big titles, maybe a league title and a domestic cup.

It was this quirky, kind of surreal film set in a city that felt very indie and underground. The main guy was this young musician, maybe in his early twenties, playing bass in a band that wasn't exactly hitting the big time. He was dating this high school girl, which his friends weren't too thrilled about, but then he meets this mysterious girl with colorful hair who he had seen in his dreams or something.  The plot gets really wild from there. He ends up having to fight a series of her exes, and each battle was like a different level in a video game, complete with over-the-top action and special effects. There was one ex who was a skateboarder, another who had superpowers, and even a girl who fought with a whip or something. The whole thing had this comic book vibe, with lots of visual gags and pop culture references.  I remember there was a scene where the band was playing in some kind of battle of the bands, and the fights would break out on stage. At one point, the main guy gets this extra life, like in a video game, and he uses it to come back after getting defeated. There was also this evil record producer who was controlling the mysterious girl somehow, and the final showdown took place in this crazy nightclub or theater.

It was this historical drama set in a really opulent palace, probably in France, with all these extravagant costumes and lavish parties. The main character was this young girl, maybe a teenager, who was sent away from her home to marry some prince or king. She had to leave everything behind, and I think there was a scene where she had to change her clothes and say goodbye to her old life in a pretty dramatic way.  The movie had this mix of modern and classical music, which felt a bit out of place but somehow worked. The girl struggled to fit in with the court's rigid rules and seemed pretty lonely despite all the grandeur around her. There was a lot of gossip and pressure on her to have a child, and I remember she had a few close friends who were her only solace. There was also this awkward tension between her and her husband, who seemed more interested in locks or something mechanical.  At some point, her brother or some relative visited and gave some pretty blunt advice to her husband, which led to them finally having a child. Despite the growing family, she became quite infamous for her lavish spending and was nicknamed something like Madame Debt or Madame Excess. The movie ended on a pretty dark note with the palace being stormed by angry crowds, signaling the end of their luxurious life.  Does anyone know what movie this might be?

She doesn't care that she's naked and, as she's slowly leaving, security guards are trying to shoot and kill her but she's either a) killing them or b) the pills can't hit her.
