One woman and two men are in the apartment. The woman is the realtor or owner of the apartment and at least one of the guys is a squator/homeless. It is a Korean or Chinese film I think.

{"query_id": "153", "query": "Pretty sure this wasn’t a dream… .\n Hear me out on this one, but I am pretty sure this was a real movie: Martial arts movie where the human is fighting aliens. Obviously not a fair fight, so there was a way that they adjusted their strengths so even the whole thing. I think there were big puppets for some of the aliens. I had to have seen this movie in the mid-90s, if in fact it is real."}

I really wanted to see it. I don’t remember that many details: Definitely remember subtitles, possibly partly English (or English v/o narration). Took place in a remote mysterious ‘boggy’ town in a country like Iceland or Scotland. (“The ground seeps”) At one point there’s a montage of people saying the name of the town and even a cat ‘says’ the name of the town. The name sounded like a cat meowing, and was something like “Moine” or “Majrn”. There was a quick shot of two (maybe brothers?) guys who look similar, and one guy leans to reveal the other in the same pose directly behind him. It reminds me of the two mustached cops with the same name in “Hot Fuzz”. I can’t remember the plot, but the main character might have been a cop or detective come to the town to investigate something, I feel like he had a crummy red car though. Please Help! Thanks."}
{"query_id": "240", "query": "Asian sci-fi movie title .\n Hello, this movie title will be a difficult one. It surely was an asian movie I used to watch when I was a kid at least 25 years ago. I am not sure about its age even back then but it was a color movie though. There was a sentient ship computer (or core) of a crashed/landed alien ship resembling a big emerald. There was a group of bad guys (the boss was a europan dude) who took it from the ship for some surely bad purpose. Then there was this group of young asian people trying to help it get back to the ship, but not before they had some fun with it. I remember the computer could alter reality for you when you were close enough to it – like this one time when one of the boys was voyeuring a girlfriend behind a window and asking the computer to make her strip down. It granted him the wish but in the end it appeared as if she was peeling away her skin to reveal a lizard one underneath, the dude was shocked and fell of a window. Then I remember the final fighting scene taking place in some ancient ruins where the ship was hidden and the evil boss using two sais (ninja weapons resembling small tridents).  The computer “died” in the end, but not before “giving birth” to its smaller successor. I tried to find it using google, searched a number of databases with sci-fi movies from 1960s-1990s with no success. But the databases are not that perfect as I did not notice them to list another movie from my childhood called “Gunhed/Ganheddo” from 1989. Any old-timer remembering this one? ?"}

The other scene was set in a house, same story. The lights were going out inside the house, and I remember clearly that if anybody touched the shadows, then they disappear or are injured.

{"query_id": "403", "query": "Masked/gloved man in fancy secret apartment. Mengele experiment. Fire. Kidnapped woman. .\n -Date: I’m not entirely sure, but I think I watched it on Netflix a year or so ago -Language: I believe it was in either German, French, or English -Where seen: I think on Netflix. It was definitely a movie. -Extras: in color, recently made, setting somewhere in Europe (Germany, France, UK) -Description: A woman wakes up in some secret underground apartment (I can’t remember if she was kidnapped or otherwise ended up there another way). The resident of the apartment is a man who wears a mask and gloves, never taking them off. He makes her breakfast. The apartment is full of art and statues and books, almost museum-like. There’s some fancy mirror somewhere and a scene takes place there. The woman at some point is in a cell where she is tortured every day. The only thing keeping her going is a letter she finds hidden in the wall that’s a first hand account of a previous woman being tortured there. When she escapes she realizes the person holding her captive and torturing her was the masked/gloved man. She’s furious and I think leaves. At some point it becomes known that the masked/gloved man was one of the people experimented on by the Angel of Death (Mengele), a nazi doctor who did experiments on twins, handicapped, elderly. The man was referred to as his cell number, and because of the experiments he developed super immunity to either disease (I think). There was a fire at the place where Mengele did the experiments and the man survived but had burns all over his body hence the mask and gloves. At some point the woman comes back. The police I think are after the masked man. I’m not sure if he gets shot, but they’re in the metro station and at some point the woman puts him (I think he was dying?) on a metro car full of flowers and bombs and sends it off to blow up. I think for some reason I can’t remember there were protests going on in the general public that were taking place at the same time as this metro car explosion."}

Also it’s a little all over the place. I remember the climax of the movie being like two grown men (possibly a Dad and a teacher – or they could’ve been next door neighbours) fighting in a school gym at night, and they end up on some kind of rock face/waterfall and someone falls, but no one dies! The following scene shows the family leaving the neighbourhood and the teacher/neighbour covered in plaster casts. I saw this movie on Sky Movies in the early 00s, I think I remember it being shown a lot. It was probably made in the late 90s. It was an American family movie. I’m pretty sure it started with the family moving into the neighbourhood with a pretty full car. And if I remember rightly, the Dad was quite a weighty/hefty dude. Sorry I haven’t included much detail but this is all I can remember! Hopefully the fight scene will ring some bells with somebody. Thanks!"}

{"query_id": "498", "query": "3 Fingered demon .\n I remember this movie from when I was younger.   I’ve no idea on the release or when exactly I watched it but it had to of been in the mid to late 80’s. Starts off with the inhabitants of a village all frantic to pack and flee as quickly as they can.   Every so many years this cult would return and bring evil with them. A young girls falls asleep or gets lost while playing with her friends in some tower or water mill type structure.  Her father stays behind searching for her. Two male backpackers traveling across the region wander into the village as the people are fleeing.  They disbelieve the legends told to them or could have not understood the meanings. The cult arrives after the dark falls and begins capturing villagers and hunting down anyone in the area.  Victims caught were hung on a cross and placed before a creature.  It would open its two arms wider revealing a third arm with three fingers extending from its chest.  When placed on the chest of the victim it would burn/brand them leaving a three fingered mark.  They would then become devoted followers. The father ends up being captured later on and he is branded. The two hikers are running down a stone staircase from some cultists when one of them falls.  With an injured leg he can no longer run so his friend pulls him aside and keeps running to lure away the cultists. I’ve no idea who stars in it,   was before my mind payed attention to those parts of the movie.  I’m sure there is more that happens but this bit is what my mind remembers the most."}
{"query_id": "512", "query": "Cannot for the life of me find this movie! .\n I saw this movie sometime around 2011-2014, someone borrowed it from a Redbox, so I would think the movie came out sometime around then. It is set in a fantasy medieval-ish kingdom. Starts of with a man being a guard, or something similar, to a king and somehow a king became a tyrant (or the king died and his son became the tyrant king?). Some people were killed (tried to run and were killed?) including this man’s family. I think this happened during the winter (unless the kingdom was always cold.) Man pretends to be a drunkard who has lost hope and goes home with a prostitute every night, but really isn’t a drunkard and pays the prostitute without actually spending any time with her and goes home, as he is only putting on an act so the king’s men will think he has given up and is not plotting revenge (but he is).  This man along with some other guys are all in on a plan to overthrow the king. Their job is to make shields and somehow use the rivets in the shield (they looked like viking shields with the rivets around the edges, if I remember correctly) as part of their plan, or messaging system to plan the plan. Something of that sort. At some point a man on the inside, as they say, has a daughter that is going to be forced to marry the king, but they smuggle the main character guy inside the castle in an ornate mirror so that he can rescue their inside man’s daughter. I’m quite sure near the end, or at the end of the movie, the group battle the king’s men outside the castle, defeats them, and it show’s the main guy ready to go into the castle to kill the king. I apologize for all the parentheses and run-on sentences, I typed it up as my brain remembered things."}

She’s blonde and I believe she was wearing some kind of red clothing. The setting of all this looked like a parking garage, but it may have had some more abstract scenery as well. A couple finds the girl in the pool, and they rush to her aid. But as they’re pulling her out, a pair of green hands grabs onto the back of her clothes and tries to pull her back in.

{"query_id": "735", "query": "Loved based story between a married couple .\n Okay, I don’t remember how this movie starts off but I remember the main events that happened. It is a movie and I’m pretty sure I seen it in around 2010-2013 but I’m not sure. So pretty much this is a love story of complications between this married couple, the husband is the one messing up and the wife is the one who keeps putting up with it. He has an addiction to porn, the wife finds out and I think it really upset her. So the husband goes to his dad for advice, to figure how to fight for someone who doesn’t love you anymore. The dad and mom are very Christian. The dad gives his son the idea of a book of I think 100 things to try and by the end of the book, he should win his wife’s love back. (That’s not an accurate count.) well he does it, surprises her with flowers, I think some breakfast and tries to take her out to dinner. By the end of the movie, he wins his wife and conquers his problem. At the end of the movie his father tells him that him and his mom had gone through the same thing, one lost love for the other and the other fought for the love back. The plot twist was that, even though the father was giving his son the advice he needed as if he had done the same thing, he actually tells his son that [he] had been the one to lose love for his mother and his mother was the one who had fought to get it back. Then the son goes back into his house where his mother and wife were, crying and apologized and hugged his mom. I believe it was because he had been avoiding her and didn’t want anything to do with her assuming that she had put his through what he had gone. But that might not be correct. I hope that’s enough to the answer of the title of this movie, I remember it and I’ve been trying 1 year to find it and figure it out but I can’t. If you know it or have any possible ideas that will lead me to it, let me know please. Thank you in advanced!"}
{"query_id": "761", "query": "Action Mystery with Mute child…? .\n So this really good movie I cannot remember when I watched it but it was definitely after 2005, it was old but really good as in I would buy this on blu ray/dvd/anything just to own it, so here are the scenes I remember: The main character(woman) finally enters into the RV, I’m pretty sure or house, the kidnapper/killer has the girl in and she finds her, and she just looks beaten down, dirty and mute and when the main character tries to talk to her the little girl just doesn’t respond. But the woman says if you ever want me to help you or you just needs something….(and some other stuff I don’t remember) then just yell out Billy(I think) and so she tries to sneak the girl out of the RV but the guy finds them and they start fighting, I think the main character is a cop maybe. But anyways they start fighting and the kidnapper/killer guy seems to be wining… Second scene I remember, is the woman has to go and turn the little girl in an orphan, and as the woman is walking away the little girl start yelling out Billy(maybe) but I know while she’s walking away the little girl is being walked away by the orphanage staff or child protective services and she starts yelling out the name the woman gave her over and over again.

Anyway, this newly married couple bought an old lighthouse or at least a house that was on a cliff overlooking the sea.The woman found a bunch of mirrors in the attic of the house that mesmerized her. She would dance in front of them. The story was a former female occupant had died in the house under suspicious circumstances, maybe she committed suicide or something. But the mirrors were haunted and the ghost arose and fought with the woman. Her husband came to help and tried to beat the ghost with a metal rod, a fire poker. Of course, the solid object went through the ghost and he actually beat his wife to death. Despondent , he thought that he saw his wife dancing in front of a window beckoning to him and he jumped through the window to his death. Another couple witnessed this whereupon the woman fainted and her husband scooped her up and rushed from the house.
