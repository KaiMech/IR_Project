{"query_id": "2004", "query": "I keep thinking about this old-time business tycoon who was super influential in shaping the American economy, but his name just won't come to me. He was born somewhere in the northeastern part of the country, I think, and his family moved around quite a bit before they finally settled in a city that was booming with industry. He started working really young, maybe as a teenager, doing some kind of bookkeeping or clerical work. By his early twenties, he was already making waves in the business world, particularly in the oil industry.  This guy was a real pioneer, founding a massive company that pretty much dominated the oil market back in the day. I remember reading that at one point, his company controlled almost all the oil in the United States. But then, there was some big legal drama, and the government stepped in and broke up his company because it was just too powerful.  After he stepped back from running his business, he became really into philanthropy. He poured a ton of his fortune into various causes, especially education and healthcare. I think he even helped start a couple of major universities. His wife was also really supportive of his charitable efforts, and together they made a huge impact on society.  I remember hearing that he was one of the richest people ever, maybe even the first billionaire in the country. His wealth was so immense that it was a significant chunk of the national economy at the time. Despite his immense fortune, he was known for being quite frugal in his personal life.  Does anyone know who I'm talking about? It's driving me nuts that I can't remember his name! Any help would be appreciated."}

The design was quite striking, almost like it was telling a story from history, perhaps something to do with a rebellion or a significant event from the past.  The view from one of the upper floors was absolutely breathtaking. There was this observation deck, I think it was on the 88th floor, where you could see the entire city spread out beneath you. They had these viewfinders that let you zoom in on different landmarks, and there was even a glass cube that extended out from the building, giving you the feeling of floating above the city. It was both thrilling and a bit nerve-wracking.  I also remember there being a restaurant and a bar on an even higher floor, maybe the 89th? The atmosphere was quite elegant, and it felt like a place where you could celebrate something special. The lifts were super fast, and I think there were about a dozen of them servicing the building.  One quirky detail that sticks with me is that they had some sort of annual event where people would climb the stairs of the building. I think it was for charity or something. And there was an experiment involving plants, testing how they would fare in such a high-rise environment.  Does anyone know which place I'm talking about?

{"query_id": "2021", "query": "I remember watching this intense movie ages ago, and it's been bugging me because I can't recall the name. It was set in the 60s, I think, in a small Southern town. The plot revolved around these two very different investigators sent to look into the disappearance of some activists. One of the investigators was this no-nonsense, by-the-book type from up north, while the other had a more laid-back, local vibe, almost like he knew the area too well.  The town was super hostile, like everyone had something to hide, and there was this constant tension in the air. The local authorities were definitely not helpful; they were almost like part of the problem. There was a scene where a house gets firebombed, and it was so chaotic and terrifying. I remember feeling the heat and the panic of that moment.  One of the most striking parts was this relationship that developed between the laid-back investigator and a local woman. She was in a really tough spot, and her husband was involved in some really dark stuff. I think she eventually broke down and revealed some crucial information, but it came at a huge personal cost.  The ending was bittersweet. They managed to bring some of the bad guys to justice, but it felt like a hollow victory because the local system was still so corrupt. There was a scene in a cemetery that really stuck with me, something about a gravestone that had a poignant message on it.  Does anyone have any idea what this movie might be? It's driving me nuts!"}

They recently took on a pretty significant role in the country, something like the head of state, I think. What's interesting is that they're the first person from a specific community to hold this position, and I believe they're also the second woman to do so. They might be the youngest to take on this role, too, which is pretty impressive.  Before this big role, they were involved in politics at a regional level, somewhere in the eastern part of the country, I think. They served as a governor for a state that's known for its rich tribal culture. I remember reading about how they were in office for quite a long time, longer than most of their predecessors.  Their early career was quite humble, starting off in some kind of clerical job and then moving on to teaching. They also held various ministerial positions in their home state, dealing with commerce and transportation, if I recall correctly. Their personal life had some really tough moments, losing close family members over a few years, which must have been incredibly hard.  They have a connection to a spiritual movement and seem to admire some of the country's historical figures like the first Prime Minister and a prominent social reformer. I think they even took a stand on some controversial land rights issues during their time as governor, which got mixed reactions.  Does anyone know who I'm talking about?

It has mild nudity (just breasts I believe) which makes me think early 70s but it definitely felt 60s at the time.  The main actor reminds me (several years on now) of Cary Grant or a young Michael Caine but I don't see anything in their IMDB that fits the scene I remember. The movie is about a cat burglar (main character) who gets into some trouble and has to either prove his innocence or do a job for someone else, pretty standard fare.  Not sure of the main plot beyond that.  What I do remember is that the movie somewhat starts off with him pilfering the apartment or hotel room of a wealthy older lady who is in the bath at the time while her husband is still downstairs entertaining.  I believe she catches him and won't let him go until she's had her fun (I'm not 100% sure about that).  Eventually he does make it out of there and back to his (or his lover's) place.  She's fairly young and a dancer so when she arrives complaining of aching feet, he rubs them for awhile before the two turn it up.  Either she complains about him needing to retire or doesn't know anything about it, I'm leaning towards the latter. I can say it's not Gambit or To Catch a Thief as neither has that scene.  Ideas?"}

One group is kind of rough around the edges, always wearing leather jackets and looking like they haven't had an easy life. The other group seems more well-off, like they come from better neighborhoods or something.  There's this one scene where two of the kids from the rougher group get into a really bad situation with some of the richer kids. It escalates quickly, and one of the rough kids ends up doing something drastic to protect his friend. They end up hiding out in this old, abandoned building, which I think was a church or something. At some point, there's a fire, and I remember the kids trying to save some younger children trapped inside. It was pretty intense.  The ending was really emotional. One of the main characters, who was kind of the heart of the group, doesn't make it. And another guy, who was really close to him, takes it really hard and does something tragic. The whole story is told from the perspective of this younger kid who's trying to make sense of everything that happened. He ends up writing about their experiences, which I think ties the whole movie together.  Does this ring a bell for anyone? I'd love to rewatch it if I can figure out what it was called!"}

The architecture reminded me a bit of those grand, old temples you see in history books, with intricate designs and a kind of solemn grandeur.  Inside, the ceiling had these amazing paintings that played tricks on your eyes, making it look like there were more dimensions than there actually were. There was this massive pipe organ that looked like it could fill the entire space with music, though I never got to hear it play. The choir seats were something else too, carved out of dark wood with such detail that you could almost feel the hands that crafted them.  I recall hearing that this place had survived all sorts of calamitiesearthquakes, wars, fires, you name it. There was even a story about it being the only building left standing after some huge disaster. During one of the wars, it was used for something quite grim, maybe as a camp or a shelter?

I think it was perched on a hill, and there was this ancient, almost medieval vibe to it, but also a touch of Baroque elegance.   This person, let's call them The Guardian, seemed to have a significant role in the place's history. I remember hearing stories about how they were involved in some major reconstructions, possibly after a big conflict, maybe even a world war. The Guardian might have been a ruler or a noble, someone who left a lasting mark on the architecture and the cultural institutions housed there today.   There was also something about a funicular railway connecting this hilltop complex to a square below, and a famous bridge nearby. The Guardian's legacy seemed intertwined with these landmarks, almost as if they were a part of the city's very fabric.   I recall wandering through a gallery or museum in this complex, and there were exhibits that seemed to celebrate The Guardian's contributions.

The plot revolves around this little creature, I think it was some kind of rodent, who has this big dream of becoming a chef. It's set in a European city, probably Paris, because there were lots of scenes with charming streets and iconic landmarks. This little guy idolizes a famous chef who had passed away, and he somehow ends up in this renowned restaurant that the chef used to run.  The rodent ends up teaming up with a clumsy young man who works in the kitchen, maybe as a cleaner or something. They form this unlikely partnership where the rodent actually helps the guy cook by hiding under his hat and pulling his hair to control his movements. It's kind of a weird but funny dynamic. There's this part where they make these amazing dishes together, and it's all very heartwarming and visually stunning.  I remember there was a twist where the young man finds out he has some sort of special connection to the famous chef, like he's a relative or something. This causes a big shake-up in the restaurant, and the current head chef, who's kind of a villain, gets ousted. There's also a stern food critic who had previously given a bad review and is coming back for another round. The climax involves them making a dish that brings back nostalgic memories for the critic, leading to a positive review.  In the end, the restaurant faces some trouble, maybe health code issues, but they open a new place that's more casual and welcoming. The rodent and his family find a new home there, and the critic becomes a regular visitor. The whole movie had this beautiful message about following your dreams and the importance of good food.

I recall the floors being really spacious, almost like they were designed to be open and free of columns, which gave it a very airy feel.  The construction of this tower seemed to have quite a backstory. I vaguely remember hearing something about it being tied to some kind of government fund or project that had its fair share of controversies. The whole area around it was still developing, with a lot of construction going on, but you could tell it was going to be a major hub once everything was finished.  One thing that stood out was the shopping mall attached to it. I think it faced some delays, maybe due to the pandemic, but it eventually opened and added a lot of life to the area. The public transport connections were pretty good too, with a couple of MRT lines running through the district, making it super accessible.  I was there with a friend, and we were both amazed by the sheer scale of the place. It felt like a blend of modern architecture and ambitious urban planning.

They had a lot of influence back in the day, even acting like early bankers or something.  The place had a fascinating history, with stories of kings and treasures. I recall hearing that it once served as a kind of royal vault, which makes sense given the knights' reputation for safeguarding valuables. There were these stone effigies inside, really old and worn, possibly from the 13th or 14th century. They looked like they were guarding the place even in death.  The church was heavily damaged during a war, I think it was the second big one, but it was meticulously restored. The surrounding area still carries the name of the knights, and there's this old gateway that used to mark some kind of boundary.

Outside, the gardens were sprawling and meticulously designed, almost like a labyrinth of greenery and stone. There were fountains, statues, and these beautifully manicured hedges that seemed to go on forever.

I was there with a couple of friends, and we spent hours just exploring and soaking in the atmosphere.

There was this one spot where you could look out over a ravine, and the view was just breathtaking. I think there was a river at the bottom, maybe called something like Gravina? The whole place had this almost mystical vibe, like it had been frozen in time.  I remember hearing that people used to live there in pretty harsh conditions until the government stepped in and moved most of them out in the mid-20th century. But now, it's become quite the tourist spot, with charming little cafes, boutique hotels, and even some pubs. It's amazing how it's transformed from a place of poverty to a vibrant cultural hub.  I also have this vague memory of the place being featured in a few movies because it looks so much like ancient Jerusalem. And there was something about it being a UNESCO site, which makes sense given how unique and historic it is. Does anyone know the name of this place? It's been bugging me for days!"}
{"query_id": "2128", "query": "I keep thinking about this actress who had a pretty diverse career, bouncing between TV hosting and acting. She started out on some kind of tech or gaming show, I think it was around the mid-2000s. It was one of those shows where they talked about video games and gadgets, and she was really charismatic and funny. I remember she did some pretty wild stunts and skits on that show.  Later on, she made a shift to more serious stuff and ended up on a satirical news show. It was around the early 2010s, and she played a correspondent, delivering these witty and sharp segments. I think she was only on that show for a short while, but she left a strong impression.  Then, she landed a role in a political drama series on HBO. She played this super smart and confident financial analyst or something like that. Her character was really intense and had some great monologues. This show was on for a few seasons, and she was definitely one of the standout characters.  I also recall her being in a few movies. One was about male strippers, directed by a well-known filmmaker. She had a pretty memorable role in that one. She also played a mutant with some kind of psychic blade powers in a superhero movie. And there was this horror-action flick where she was part of a team hunting down an alien creature.  Her background is quite interesting too. She has a mixed heritage, with roots in Asia and Europe. I think her mom had a pretty tough journey coming to the U.S. as a refugee. She moved around a lot as a kid because of her stepdad's military career, but they eventually settled in the Midwest. She studied journalism in college, which might explain her knack for delivering lines with such conviction.  She's also been quite vocal about social issues, especially around animal rights and anti-Asian sentiment. I vaguely remember her being involved in some high-profile movements and speaking out against some big names in Hollywood.  In her personal life, she dated a famous football player for a few years and is now with a comedian. They have a kid together, and I think she recently shared some pretty tough news about her health.  Does anyone know who I'm talking about? It's driving me nuts trying to remember her name!"}

It's this grand, white stone structure, kind of like a giant doorway, but it's not a building you can enter. I remember it being in a park, a pretty popular one in a bustling city. The structure itself is quite tall, maybe around 70 or 80 feet, and it has these intricate carvings and statues on it. I think it was built to honor some important historical figure, maybe a president or a military leader, but I'm not entirely sure.  I remember walking through this park with some friends, and we were all struck by how majestic and almost ancient this archway felt, even though it's not really ancient. It kind of reminded me of those old Roman arches you see in history books. There were these large stars carved into it, and I think there were some smaller stars too, but my memory is a bit fuzzy on the details.  One thing that really stood out was the statues on either side of the arch. They seemed to represent different virtues or ideals, like bravery or wisdom. I think one of the statues was of the historical figure the arch commemorates, but again, I'm not entirely sure. The whole place had this mix of grandeur and a bit of wear and tear, like it had seen a lot over the years. I remember hearing that it had been cleaned up and restored at some point, maybe in the early 2000s.  Does anyone know what I'm talking about? It's been bugging me, and I'd love to hear if anyone else has memories of this place or knows its name."}

It was this massive, gleaming skyscraper that seemed to pierce the sky, almost like it was trying to touch the clouds. The building had this futuristic vibe, with sleek lines and a spire that made it look like something out of a sci-fi movie. I think it was the tallest thing around for miles, and it had this incredible observation deck where you could see the entire city sprawled out below you.  I was with a couple of friends, and we had just come from a nearby historic stadium, which I think had something to do with independence or freedom. There was also this charming old street market nearby, filled with the aroma of street food and the chatter of vendors. The whole area felt like a blend of the old and the new, with this towering structure standing as a testament to modern engineering amidst the historical surroundings.  The skyscraper itself was part of a larger complex, with offices, hotels, and even a shopping mall. I remember we spent some time wandering through a beautifully landscaped park that surrounded the building. It was a mix of urban and green spaces, creating a serene escape from the city's hustle and bustle.  One thing that stood out was the building's commitment to sustainability. I heard it was the first in the country to achieve some kind of triple platinum rating for being eco-friendly. The whole experience was surreal, almost like stepping into the future while still being rooted in the past.  Does anyone know which place I'm talking about? It's been bugging me for a while, and I'd love to revisit those memories. Any guesses?"}
{"query_id": "2155", "query": "weird movie about smugglers looking for teenage boy .\n So we saw this movie a few years ago.  It was pretty weird , but lately I keep thinking about it. This is what I remember.  Foreign film (french?).  I think it might have been silent (or very little spoken dialogue). Mother, father, young teenage girl.  Mother is a pianist.  Wealthy family.  They move from the city to somewhere remote. There is some kind of accident or crash or drug deal gone wrong that happens near their house.  One survivor (the only one?) of the mayhem is a young teenage boy who was shot.  The girl hides him in one of the family's outbuildngs, and tends to his serious abdominal/intestinal wounds.  Turns out the bad guys were smuggling stuff inside his body (I think drugs) and naturally they are going to come looking for him.  The boy slowly begins to mend.  The bad guys hang around the family property and shoot the family's dog.  The girl takes the boy to a school function or dance.  For camouflage, he is dressed as a girl.  While there, his abdominal wounds start to bleed profusely; the blood is very visible on the white dress he is wearing, and somehow the nuns believe he has just reached puberty.  Odd, since he is bleeding from the abdomen. The boy and girl fall in love.  The bad guys are still looking for him/them.  The boy and girl leave her home for the old empty house in the city.  The bad guy(s) find them in the house.  They die together, shot, maybe in the house but I keep picturing another location.  Empty, sad, depressing, lonely, weird and I still don't know what the point is. Any one out there seen this thing? THANKS!!"}

They have three kids, and the kids start seeing the mom as this super strict, no-fun person.   Anyway, the parents decide to do this thing where they have to say yes to everything the kids ask for one whole day. I remember them doing all sorts of crazy stuff like dressing up in weird outfits and eating this gigantic ice cream sundae. There's also this scene where they go through a car wash with the windows down, which was hilarious and chaotic.  One of the kids, the older daughter, wants to go to some music festival, and there's a bit of drama around that. I think the parents end up getting into trouble at an amusement park, and there's a big confrontation. The kids sneak off somewhere, and there's a moment where the daughter feels really let down by her friend, but then she and her mom have this heart-to-heart moment at the festival.  The day ends with the family camping out in their backyard, but then something crazy happens with a foam bomb or something, and it starts filling the house. There's also a bit at the end where they get back at this guy who gave them the idea for the day by throwing Kool-Aid balloons at him.  Does anyone know what movie I'm talking about?

One of those movies had him holding a boombox over his head in a really iconic scene, if that rings any bells.  He also did some more serious stuff later on, like this one film where he was a hitman going back to his high school reunion. That one was a mix of dark comedy and action, and it was pretty unique for its time. I remember he was also in a movie with a lot of famous faces, something about a plane full of convicts, and he played a good guy trying to sort out the mess.  His family is kind of a big deal too, I think. He has a sister who's also an actress, and they might have even been in a movie together at some point. Their last name is pretty distinctive, but it's just not coming to me right now. He's also known for being quite vocal about his political views, often stirring up conversations on social media.

Anyway, he wasn't the lead singer in that group, but he played guitar and maybe drums too.  Later on, he started his own project, which had this really catchy song about getting better. I think it was around 2014 or so. His solo stuff has this nostalgic, almost 80s vibe, but with a modern twist. He's also worked with a ton of big names in the music industryI'm talking major pop stars and indie darlings alike. I remember one of his collaborations was with a young female artist who had a big hit about shaking things off.  He's won a bunch of awards, including some big ones for producing, and I think he might have even won something three years in a row recently. He's also been pretty open about his mental health struggles, which I found really relatable and inspiring. Oh, and I think he got married to an actress not too long ago.

I saw it during a rainy weekend at my cousin's place, and we were flipping through channels when we stumbled upon this quirky, dark comedy. The main character was this really awkward guy who was obsessed with becoming a famous comedian. He had this kind of desperate, almost creepy vibe, but you couldn't help but feel a bit sorry for him.  He idolized this big-time talk show host, who was like the epitome of success in the comedy world. I remember there was a scene where the main guy somehow managed to meet his idol, but things didn't go as planned. The host was pretty dismissive, and it just fueled the main guy's obsession even more.  Things got really wild when the main guy decided to take some drastic measures. I think he ended up kidnapping the talk show host or something? It was all part of this crazy plan to get his big break on TV. There was this intense moment where he finally got to perform his comedy routine, and the audience was laughing, but it was hard to tell if they were in on the joke or just thought it was part of the act.  I also vaguely remember a line about it being better to be a king for a night than something else, which really stuck with me. The ending was kind of ambiguous too, like you weren't sure if he actually became famous or if it was all in his head. Does anyone have any idea what movie this could be? It's driving me nuts!"}

He wasn't the main hero, but he had a significant role, kind of like the hero's best friend or something. He had this intense, brooding vibe but could also be really funny.  I also recall him doing some quirky, offbeat comedies with another actor who's known for his comedic roles. They had this great chemistry, and one of their movies involved a lot of, let's say, herbal humor. I think they even did an animated film together that was pretty raunchy.  He's also done some serious roles. There was this one movie where he played a real-life person who got stuck in a dire situation and had to make a drastic decision to survive. That performance was really gripping, and I think he got some award buzz for it.  On TV, he was in this short-lived but beloved show about high school misfits. He played this cool, rebellious guy, and I think it was one of his breakout roles. He's also done some soap opera stuff, which seemed kind of random given his other work.  I remember hearing that he's really into education and has taught classes at various schools.

There was a scene at a car race, and I think they even got into a car chase at some point. The couple eventually figured out who the killers were, and it turned out to be this dramatic reveal involving a couple of the guests who wanted the inheritance.

His early stuff had that acoustic, storytelling feel, but then he made this huge shift to electric guitar, which I remember caused quite a stir among his fans. Some people were really upset about it, but others thought it was groundbreaking.   There was also a period where he seemed to disappear from the public eye for a bit  I think it was after some kind of accident? When he came back, his music had this different flavor, more country or something. And then, later on, he even dabbled in gospel music for a while, which was another surprising turn.

There was a restaurant downstairs that served the most amazing food, and I think there was even a spa.   One night, we took a tour that talked about the history of the place, and it was fascinating but also a bit creepy. They mentioned something about the original owner's health improving dramatically after he moved there, and how the hotel played a big role in developing the surrounding area into a resort town.

I remember him being a huge deal in the Indian film industry, especially in the southern part of the country. He has this larger-than-life presence and has been in some epic movies that were massive hits, not just regionally but all over India. One of his films, I think, was about a warrior prince or something, and it had these grand battle scenes and a storyline that spanned generations. It was so popular that it even got a sequel, which broke all sorts of box office records.  I think he started his career with some smaller, more dramatic roles before moving on to these big action-packed films. He's often referred to with a nickname that implies he's a bit of a maverick or a rebel, if that helps. I remember reading somewhere that he's one of the highest-paid actors in his industry and has been featured in some celebrity lists for years.  Oh, and there was something about him having a wax statue in a famous museum, which is pretty rare for actors from his region. He's also done some humanitarian work, especially during the pandemic, making significant donations and supporting various causes.  I recall a few of his other movies being quite popular too, like one where he played a sort of Robin Hood character, and another where he was involved in some intense family drama.

He did a lot of different characters, and his impressions were pretty spot-on. I think he played a political figure or two, and he had this knack for quirky, offbeat humor.  He also had this show with a female co-star, something about a quirky city in the Pacific Northwest. It was full of these oddball characters and satirical takes on hipster culture. I think the show was on some niche cable network, not one of the big ones.   Besides acting, he's really into music. I remember seeing him play drums on a late-night talk show, and I think he was part of the house band. He's got this punk rock background, and I vaguely recall he was in a band that had a pretty underground following.  His personal life is kind of a blur, but I think he's been married a couple of times, and he dated an actress who's known for her roles in indie films and TV shows.

I was there with a group of friends, and we were all struck by the sheer size of the building. It felt like stepping into a different era. There was this sense of reverence, almost like being in a cathedral, but it wasn't a church. Inside, it was quite spacious, with high ceilings and intricate details that made you want to look up and just take it all in.  I vaguely recall reading something about a famous leader and his wife being laid to rest there. The story behind it was quite touching, involving a lot of effort and dedication from the community to honor this person's legacy. There were talks of a statue that was supposed to be outside, but I don't remember seeing it. Maybe it was never completed?  The place had seen better days, though. There were signs of wear and tear, and I think there was some kind of restoration effort going on at the time.

There was a lot of buzz because this new place is supposed to open just in time for a major sports season. I think it's also going to be used for some big international sports event in a few years.   There were some legal hiccups along the way, with some local groups and a nearby venue causing a bit of a stir. I think the owner of the basketball team ended up buying out the nearby venue to smooth things over. This new place is supposed to have a ton of seats, a fancy practice area, and even a medical clinic. I remember something about a crazy amount of restrooms too, which is kind of funny but practical.  One of the coolest things I heard about was this double-sided screen or board that's supposed to be a big deal. They're also planning to host all sorts of events, not just basketball games.

She started acting pretty young, and I distinctly remember her in some period dramas and historical films when she was just a kid.   One of her early roles was in a scandalous movie about a teacher-student relationship, and she also had a part in a film about two sisters competing for the affection of a king. She's got this unique look, kind of elfin, and she often plays quirky or intense characters. I think she was in a movie with musketeers and another one with a dark knight, but not the main roles, more like supporting characters that really stood out.  In recent years, she's been in a popular comedy series about an American coach in England and a crime drama set in the Midwest. She's been nominated for some big awards, maybe even won a few. I remember reading about her winning something that recognized her as a rising star a while back. She's also been in some music videos and won an award at a film festival in Prague for a role in an indie film about mental health.

His family had a big influence on him, especially his grandpa, who always believed he'd be a star.   He played college ball at one of those big southern schools, the kind that's always in the national championship conversation. I think he won some big awards and even led his team to a title early on. There was this one game where he came in and just lit it up, like a real underdog story. But then, he had some injury issues, something serious with his hip, I believe, and people were worried if he'd ever play again.  Despite that, he got picked pretty high in the draft by a team that's known for its aquatic mascot. His rookie year was kind of a mixed bag, sometimes starting, sometimes not. But he really started to shine a couple of years in, leading the league in some important stats and even making it to the Pro Bowl.  Off the field, he's really into giving back, has some foundation for kids or something. And I think he's into martial arts to stay in shape and avoid injuries.

I believe the colours of the room were very dim and dull. There is a possibility that it may have been done in stop-motion, although I am fairly certain it was not claymation. Two people were seated facing each other and it was a mealtime. One of them pulled the other's tie like a dumbwaiter rope, reached into his button-down shirt, and pulled a tray of food out.

She's older now and under the care of a guardian and some doctor who's trying to help her with these weird, repressed memories.  There was this priest, kind of lost in his faith, who gets involved in investigating the death of another priest who had something to do with the girl's past. His journey takes him to some really unexpected places, like Africa, where he learns about this boy with special powers to fight an evil entity. The girl, who has some psychic abilities, ends up helping another kid with some condition, which shocks the doctors.  One scene that stands out is when they use this bizarre machine to sync their minds or something. It was all very trippy and unsettling. The climax happens in this old house, which I think was significant in the first movie. There's this intense showdown with the evil force, and the priest has to resist some kind of temptation. The ending was pretty dramatic with the girl banishing the evil, but not everyone makes it out alive.

The younger brother always seemed to be living in the shadow of the older one, which created this underlying tension throughout the movie.  The rich guy, who was a bit of an oddball, invites the younger brother to join his team or club, offering him a lot of support and resources. At first, everything seems to be going well, but things start to get weird. The rich guy's behavior becomes more and more erratic, and he starts pushing the younger brother into some unhealthy habits, like drugs. The younger brother's performance starts to suffer, and you can see him spiraling downwards.  Eventually, the older brother gets involved too, moving his family to be closer to the team. But the relationship between the rich guy and the brothers just keeps getting worse. There's this really tense atmosphere, and you can feel things are heading towards a bad ending. The climax is super shocking  the rich guy ends up doing something terrible to the older brother, which was just heartbreaking.

I remember a scene where she was attacked, and these creatures saved her. They lived in a really unusual place, like underground or something, and they had this quirky, almost sibling-like dynamic.  One of the creatures had a bit of a temper and got into a fight with this guy who wore a hockey mask and carried sports equipment as weapons. There was also a part where their home got destroyed, and they had to hide out in this old farmhouse to regroup.

There was this huge artificial volcano that would erupt, complete with fire and water effects. It was like something out of a movie, and it drew crowds every night. I remember standing there, feeling the heat from the flames and hearing the gasps from the crowd. It was almost hypnotic.  The resort itself was enormous, with thousands of rooms and a casino that seemed to stretch on forever. I think it was one of the most expensive places built at the time, and you could tell. Everything was over-the-top luxurious, from the indoor tropical forest to the elaborate shows they hosted. There was this one magic duo, famous for their white tigers, who performed there for years. Their show was a huge draw.  I also vaguely recall that the place went through some big changes recently.

The whole thing was set in this really confined space, like a call center or something, and the main character was this troubled guy working a night shift. He was dealing with some serious personal issues, maybe something about a court case or an incident from his past job.   Anyway, the plot kicks off when he gets this super distressing call from a woman who says she's been kidnapped. She's in a vehicle, maybe a van, and the situation just spirals from there. The guy on the phone tries to help her, but he's stuck in his office and can only communicate through calls. I think he talks to her young daughter at some point, and there's something about the kid's father having a violent history.  The tension kept building, and there was this heartbreaking twist involving the woman's mental state and her kids. I remember a scene where the main guy has to confront his own demons while trying to save her. It was so gripping and emotional, especially when he reveals something dark about his past to try and stop her from doing something drastic.  Does anyone have any idea what this movie might be? It's driving me nuts! I think it came out fairly recently, maybe in the last few years. Any help would be awesome!"}
{"query_id": "2418", "query": "I remember watching this movie ages ago, and it's been bugging me because I can't recall the name. It was this hilarious mockumentary about a rock bandBritish, I thinkon a tour in the US. The band was known for being incredibly loud, and they had this quirky manager who was always trying to keep things together, but everything kept going wrong.   There was this one scene where they had a stage prop that was supposed to be this grand, ancient monument, but it ended up being ridiculously small. The band members were all childhood friends, and they had this long history of changing their band name and style. At one point, they were into this flower power vibe with a song that had something to do with flowers or peace, but then they shifted to heavy metal.  I also remember something about their drummers having a really bad luck streaklike, they kept dying in weird ways. One of the drummers even exploded on stage, if I recall correctly. The band's popularity was on the decline, and there were a lot of internal conflicts, especially when one of the band members' girlfriends joined the tour and started meddling in their decisions.  There was this bit about their album cover being controversial because it was just plain black, and it caused a lot of issues. Towards the end, one of the main guys left the band after some equipment failure, but then he came back with news that one of their songs was a hit in Japan. They ended up reuniting and going on a successful tour there, despite more funny mishaps.  Does anyone have any idea what movie this could be? It's driving me nuts!"}

It was nestled in a quiet, leafy neighborhood, and I think it had a pretty significant history tied to some notable political figures. The house itself was quite large, with a sprawling yard that seemed to stretch forever, though I think the property might have been smaller than it originally was.  The place had this aura of old-world charm mixed with a sense of modernity, probably because it had been renovated a few times over the years. I recall hearing stories about a famous book being written there, something that won a prestigious award. The family who lived there had a lot of kids, and I remember imagining the laughter and chaos that must have filled those halls.  There was also talk about a high-profile legal figure who lived there before it became associated with this well-known family. The house had these beautiful, expansive rooms, and I think there was a significant renovation in the mid-20th century that added to its grandeur.  I visited the area once, and the house stood out with its elegant brick facade and lush greenery. It felt like stepping back in time, yet there was a sense of ongoing life and history being made. The place was sold not too long ago, and I heard it underwent some major updates.  Does anyone know the name of this place or have more details about its history? I'm trying to piece together my memories and would love to hear if anyone else has visited or knows more about it."}

I think he was originally from France, and he might have started his career in his hometown club, which had a name that sounded like a city known for its food and wine.  This guy was known for his technical skills and vision. I remember watching a game where he made this insane assist that left everyone in awe. He was also quite versatile, playing different roles on the field. He had a long stint with his Spanish club, winning a ton of trophies, including some big European ones. I think he even won a prestigious individual award recently, maybe a year or two ago.  He had a bit of a controversial international career, if I recall correctly. There was some drama, and he was out of the national team for a while, but then he came back and made a significant impact. I remember a tournament where he scored some crucial goals.  Oh, and I think he recently moved to a club in the Middle East. It's not one of the usual big European leagues, but he's still making headlines there. Does anyone know who I'm talking about? It's driving me nuts!"}

I vaguely recall him being on a show where he was a student at some fancy school or something like that.   Later, he was in a series about a girl who was a writer, or maybe she was a journalist? It was set in the past, like the '80s or '90s. He also did some kind of fantasy series with elves and magic, which was pretty cool but didn't last very long.   I remember he made a big splash in a movie by that director who loves to mix historical events with fictional stories. He played a real-life person who was part of a notorious group, and he was really convincing in that role.   More recently, he got a lot of attention for playing a famous musician in a biopic. He even won some major awards for it. I think he was named one of the most influential people recently, which is pretty impressive.   Does anyone know who I'm talking about? I think he was also into music himself and had some high-profile relationships. Any help would be appreciated!"}

He was really good at scoring goals, like, he was always at the top of the charts.  I remember he moved to a really big club on a free transfer, which was a huge deal at the time. This guy was instrumental in winning a bunch of league titles and even a major European tournament. I think he was part of a team that won everything in one season, which was pretty rare. He's also known for being a top scorer in multiple competitions in the same season.  On the international stage, he's been a key player for his national team for over a decade. I think he's their all-time top scorer or something like that. He's played in several major tournaments, but I can't recall how well his team did.  Off the field, he's quite the philanthropist and has invested in various business ventures. I remember reading about him donating a lot to children's hospitals and other causes. He's married to someone who's also pretty famous in her own right, maybe a former athlete or something. They have a couple of kids, and he speaks multiple languages fluently.  He's won some major individual awards too, like being named the best player in the world a couple of times. I think he's also won the top scorer award in Europe for a couple of seasons.

I remember hearing that he worked with some really big names, like a famous crooner and a legendary bandleader. They did some amazing stuff together that people still talk about.  I also recall that he had a hand in some of the biggest pop hits ever. There's this one pop starhe was massive in the '80s, wore a lot of flashy clothes, and had some killer dance moves. This guy I'm thinking of produced some of his most iconic albums, including one that's like the best-selling album ever. He was also involved in this huge charity single where a bunch of famous artists came together to sing for a cause. I think it was in the mid-'80s?  He's not just about music, though. I'm pretty sure he's done a lot of work in movies and TV too. I vaguely remember something about him being one of the first African Americans to achieve some major milestones in the industry, like being nominated for big awards or holding high-ranking positions at record companies.  I think he was born in a big city, maybe Chicago, and had a pretty tough childhood. There's something about his family moving to the West Coast, where he really started to shine musically. He went to a high school that's known for producing a lot of talented people and then got some kind of scholarship to a university before transferring to a famous music college.  He's also known for his activism and philanthropy, working with some pretty high-profile figures and causes. I remember hearing about him supporting civil rights movements and collaborating with other famous activists.  Does anyone know who I'm talking about?

{"query_id": "2459", "query": "I remember visiting this ancient, awe-inspiring place during a trip down south, somewhere near a river. It was a massive temple complex, and the sheer size of the main tower left me speechless. This tower, which I think was one of the tallest in the region, seemed to touch the sky. The whole structure was made of this sturdy, greyish stone, maybe granite? It felt like stepping back in time, into an era of kings and empires.  The courtyard was vast, with a long, colonnaded corridor that seemed to go on forever. There were shrines everywhere, each dedicated to different deities. I distinctly remember a huge statue of a bull, possibly Nandi, and several smaller shrines for other gods and goddesses. The main deity was a massive figure, a Shiva linga, if I recall correctly. There were also some stunning sculptures, including one of a dancing figure, which I think was Shiva in his Nataraja form.  The place had this incredible energy, a mix of serenity and grandeur. I remember the walls being adorned with intricate carvings and frescoes, though some parts seemed to have been added or renovated over the centuries. There was even a moat around it, which added to the fortress-like feel of the place.  I went there with a group of friends, and we spent hours just wandering around, soaking in the history and the artistry. The temple was bustling with activity, with pilgrims and tourists alike. It was one of those places that left a lasting impression, a testament to the architectural and cultural achievements of its time.  Does anyone know the name of this place? It's been bugging me for a while, and I'd love to revisit it, even if just in my memories. Any help would be appreciated!"}

The city itself was a treasure trove of history, with these incredible temples and tombs. One of the temples, in particular, was dedicated to a pharaoh whose name started with an S  maybe Seti or something similar. This temple had this long list of pharaohs inscribed on its walls, which was pretty mind-blowing. I remember seeing some ancient graffiti too, not sure if it was Phoenician or Aramaic, but it was definitely old and fascinating.  There was also this mysterious underground structure, possibly linked to some deity worship, maybe Osiris? The whole place had this eerie yet captivating vibe. And then there was this ancient brewery they found, supposedly the oldest in the world, dating back thousands of years. The whole area felt like a blend of myth and history, with layers of stories buried under modern buildings.  Does anyone know the name of this place? It's driving me nuts!

He also ran for president at least once, maybe twice, and I think he lost to that really charismatic guy who was in office before the last couple of presidents.   I remember he had a pretty significant role in organizing a major sporting event, like the Winter Olympics or something, and it really boosted his public profile. He's also connected to some religious group, possibly Mormon, and spent some time abroad in Europe, maybe France, doing missionary work.

The place was a sprawling complex of red-brick ruins, and it had this almost mystical aura about it. I think it was once a major center for learning, attracting scholars from all over Asia. The ruins were extensive, with remnants of what seemed like lecture halls, dormitories, and even a massive library that supposedly housed countless manuscripts.  One of the most striking memories I have is of these tall, silent statues of Buddha scattered throughout the site. They seemed to be watching over the place, almost as if they were guardians of the knowledge that once thrived there. There was also this massive stupa that stood out, surrounded by smaller, intricately carved stupas. The carvings were so detailed, depicting scenes that looked like they were straight out of ancient tales.  I recall hearing stories about how this place was supported by various rulers and patrons, not just from India but from far-off lands as well. It was fascinating to think about how it must have been a melting pot of cultures and ideas. The site also had a serene, almost meditative quality to it, despite the bustling crowds of tourists.  I remember my dad mentioning something about a famous Chinese traveler who had studied there and later wrote extensively about his experiences. There was also talk of an attack that led to the decline of this once-great institution, but it somehow managed to survive for a while after that.  Does anyone know the name of this place?

It was about this boxer who was at the top of his game, like a real champion, but then his life just fell apart. I think he had a wife and a daughter, and they seemed really close. There was this intense scene where something tragic happened at a fancy event, maybe a charity thing? I remember it was really shocking, and it involved a gunshot.  After that, the main guy just spiraled out of control. He started drinking a lot and getting into fights outside the ring. There was this heartbreaking moment where he lost custody of his daughter, and it was just so raw and emotional. I think he ended up in some pretty rough places, like maybe he even lost his house or something.  At some point, he tries to turn his life around and seeks help from this older, kind of grizzled trainer. The trainer was reluctant at first, maybe because of the boxer's reputation or his own past, but eventually, they start working together. The training scenes were really intense, with a lot of focus on discipline and getting back in shape.  The climax was this big fight against a rival who might have been connected to the earlier tragedy. The whole thing was super tense, and I remember the crowd going wild. In the end, the boxer wins, and there's this really touching reunion with his daughter. It was such an emotional rollercoaster, and the ending was both uplifting and bittersweet.

There was this awkward tension throughout the movie, especially when she ran into an old flame, a woman who seemed to have her life more together. But things got even more complicated when this older guy showed up with his wife and baby. The guy had some sort of secret relationship with the main character, and his wife was totally oblivious. The whole situation was super uncomfortable, with lots of side glances and whispered conversations.  I remember a scene where the main character was in the bathroom, and something embarrassing happened with her clothes. She also left her phone behind, which led to more awkwardness. There was this chaotic moment where she knocked over some important items, and it felt like everything was falling apart for her.  The movie had this claustrophobic feel, with everyone crammed into this small space, and the main character's anxiety was almost palpable.

She's quite young, probably in her early twenties, and I remember she's known for having a really powerful serve and a fearless playing style. There was this one match where she just dominated with her baseline shots, and it was so impressive. I think she's also the first from her current country to achieve some major milestones, like reaching the top ranks in the world.

It kind of looked like a giant molecule or something scientific, but way cooler.  We went there as part of a school trip, and I remember being blown away by how enormous it was. You could actually go inside these spheres, and they had all sorts of exhibits and displays. There was even one sphere at the top with a restaurant that had an amazing view of the city. I remember the food being pretty good, but it was the view that really stuck with me. You could see the whole city laid out below, and it felt like you were floating above everything.

It centered around two kids in particular. A boy who could control minds and a girl who could heal. The main character is a buy who is investing this government facility and in the end is trying to help shut it down. Specially he helps the girl escape. The two main scenes I remember is the girl that can heal finds a dead or wounded bird during recess at school with the investigator there and then after she holds it he notices later that the bird was either alive again or able to fly again. The other scene I remember is the boy with mind control abilities that the government used and was sort of the villain takes over the investigating guy while he has the girl with him and stops on train tracks and locks them both in the truck to get hit by the train.

The whole thing was narrated by this older guy who seemed to be a doctor or something, and he was really into exploring the darker side of life and death.   There were all these disturbing scenes, like a mix of real and staged footage, showing all sorts of gruesome ways people and animals met their end. One part that really stuck with me was this intense scene with a SWAT team in a gunfight, and then there was this other bit where they showed someone getting executed in an electric chair. It was all very graphic and unsettling.  The narrator had this recurring dream that seemed to drive him to explore these morbid topics, and he kept questioning why people are so violent. There were also parts about war and some really creepy stuff involving a snake cult and cannibalism. I think there was even a segment about a plane crash and a failed parachute jump, which added to the overall eerie vibe.  Towards the end, the movie took a weird turn into the supernatural, with the narrator investigating a guy who thought his dead family was communicating with him. The final scenes were a strange mix of macabre and peaceful imagery, like showing a baby's birth right after all these horrific scenes. It left me feeling really uneasy but also fascinated.

I had thought this was a Tom Hanks film, but when I go through his IMDB, none of the titles/images brings it to mind, so I'm thinking in that I'm mistaken. So, what I do remember is that the main character during part of the film works as a volunteer chemical tester, being exposed to various chemical substances that among other things, destroys his sense of smell, and with it his sense of taste. He ends up working at jobs that most anyone would rather not do, since they are so unpleasant (I think one of those jobs was in a salt factory, as I feel I remember seeing him slipping and tumbling down a huge pile of some grainy/almost powdery stuff), and lives his life on the small wages he can make, and the disability checks he gets for the residual damages from the chemical exposures. I'm pretty sure it was a dark comedy, as it vacillated between the humor of the things he went through, and the dark, near empty life he led. Even touching on the fact that his limited finances weren't too bad, as without a sense of taste, he just ate the same meals every day, cause it was cheap and easy (spaghetti). I can't remember what else happens, just images of him in a test chamber getting flooded with various gasses/chemicals, and taking off his mask (if he even had one to begin with), and hacking/coughing/sneezing, being treated badly by bosses, and that scene of him trying to move across, or up that huge pile of near sandy stuff, slipping, tumbling and falling, and getting frustrated with it all I know, this is pretty vague, but I'm really hoping someone can help me find this one, as I'd like to check it out again, if for no better reason than to give it context, so that isn't the only parts I can recall about it Thanks for any help!"}

He gets hired by this really elegant woman, probably an heiress or something, to find her missing lover. The lover was involved in the film industry, I think he worked with props or something like that.  Anyway, the detective finds out that the guy supposedly died in a pretty gruesome way, like getting run over or something, but then the woman claims she saw him alive in some border town. There was this whole thing with a fancy club where the detective tries to get info but ends up in more trouble. I remember a scene where he visits a grave and sees a mysterious woman mourning, but she runs off before he can talk to her.  There was also this subplot with a drug lord and some stolen drugs, and the detective gets mixed up in that mess too. At one point, he gets captured and has to fake being poisoned to escape. There was a lot of sneaking around and double-crossing, and I think the detective had a friend in the police force who helped him out.  The ending was pretty intense, with a showdown at some club and the detective finding out some dark truths. There was a fire, a betrayal, and the detective had to make a tough choice about whether to expose the truth or let it slide. The whole thing had this moody, atmospheric vibe, and the characters were all morally grey.  Does anyone have any idea what movie this might be? It's driving me nuts!"}

It was such a surreal experience, almost like something out of a sci-fi movie.  The view from the top was absolutely breathtaking. There was this observatory, I think they called it something like a floating garden, where you could see the entire city sprawling out beneath you. The skyline was dotted with other tall buildings, but none quite as unique as this one. I remember the feeling of the wind up there, cool and refreshing, and the way the city lights twinkled as the sun set.  At the base of the building, there was this underground market that felt like stepping back in time. It had an old-world charm, with narrow alleys and vintage-style shops. There were also some lovely gardens with winding paths and little water features, perfect for a quiet stroll.  I stayed at a hotel nearby, which was super convenient because it was close to a couple of major train stations. I think one of the companies in the building was a car manufacturer, and there was also a consulate and some other big names.  Does anyone know what this place might be called?

The stones are huge and weathered, and some parts of the wall look like they've been there forever, while other sections seem like they were added later. I think it might have been a retaining wall for something very important, maybe a temple or a significant religious site.  The atmosphere was incredibly solemn, with people pressing their foreheads against the stones, slipping pieces of paper with prayers into the cracks. There was a sense of deep reverence and history, almost like you could feel the weight of centuries of devotion in the air. I remember there were different areas for men and women to pray, and it was always bustling with activity, from religious ceremonies to personal moments of reflection.  I also recall hearing that this place has seen many changes in control and access over the years, especially during various periods of conquest and rule. There were stories about it being a focal point for different faiths, and I think there was something about a prophet and a mystical journey involving a steed tied to the wall.  One of the most striking memories is the sound of prayers and chants filling the air, mingling with the rustle of paper and the murmur of voices. It felt like a place where the past and present were intertwined, where every stone had a story to tell.  Does anyone know the name of this place?

It was about this guy who was in the military, I think, and he had this intense training with a wise old master. The master had a son who passed away, and somehow this guy ended up being like a surrogate son or something. There was this whole backstory about him trying to steal a sword, but instead of getting in trouble, he got trained by the master.   The main plot revolved around this underground fighting tournament in some Asian city, maybe Hong Kong? The tournament was super secretive and illegal, and the fighters were from all over the world. The protagonist had to sneak away from his military duties to compete. He had this big, burly American friend who was also a fighter, and they had a local guide who helped them navigate the city and the tournament.  There was also a journalist, an American woman, who was trying to uncover the secrets of the tournament. She and the main guy had a bit of a thing going on, but he was really focused on competing. I remember a scene where his friend got badly beaten by this ruthless champion, who was like the big bad of the movie. The protagonist swore to avenge his friend and kept advancing through the rounds.  At some point, there were these two agents or officers chasing him around the city, trying to bring him back to his duties. There was a chase scene that was pretty intense, but he managed to evade them. In the final fight, the bad guy did something underhanded, like throwing powder in the protagonist's eyes to blind him. But the hero remembered his training and fought through it, eventually winning the tournament.  The ending had him saying goodbye to the journalist and his friend before heading back with the agents. Does anyone know what movie this could be? It's driving me crazy!"}
{"query_id": "2574", "query": "I'm trying to recall this one football figure, and it's driving me nuts. He was quite the chameleon on the field, playing in various positions, mostly midfield or forward, if I remember correctly. He had this incredible stamina and a bit of a fiery temperament. I think he played for two major Spanish clubs, and I want to say it was during the '90s and early 2000s. One of those clubs had a white kit, and the other had a blue and red one. He was quite successful, scoring over 100 goals and playing more than 500 games, I believe.  This guy also had a significant international career, representing Spain in multiple World Cups and a European Championship. After hanging up his boots, he transitioned into management. I remember he started with a B team of one of those big clubs and then moved on to manage in Italy and another Spanish team before returning to one of his former clubs. He led them to some major victories, including a treble and a double in consecutive seasons.  More recently, he took charge of the Spanish national team, leading them to the Euro 2020 semi-finals and a Nations League final. I think he stepped down after the 2022 World Cup. Now, he's managing a top French club and already won a few domestic trophies in his first season. His coaching style is quite flexible and direct, and he's considered one of the top managers of his time.  Does anyone know who I'm talking about? Any help would be appreciated!"}
{"query_id": "2578", "query": "There's this actress I've been trying to remember, and it's driving me nuts. She was one of those classic Hollywood stars, you know, from the era when movies had that black-and-white charm. I think she was really big in the 1940s and 50s. She had this sultry, almost mysterious vibe about her, and she was known for her striking looks and captivating performances.  I remember she was in this film noir that had a lot of tension and drama. I think it was about a heist or something, and her role was pretty pivotal. She had this way of drawing you in with just a look. I also recall she was in a movie set in Africa, where she played opposite a couple of big male stars of the time. There was a lot of talk about her performance in that one.  Her personal life was quite the rollercoaster too. She had a few high-profile marriages, and one of her husbands was a famous singer who was quite the heartthrob himself. They had a tumultuous relationship, but it seemed like there was a lot of passion there. She also had some interesting friendships with other big names, like a reclusive billionaire and a famous writer who loved adventure.  I think she was from the South, maybe from a small town, and she had a bit of an accent when she started out. There's something about her being discovered through a photograph, if I'm not mixing things up. Later in life, she moved to Europe and spent her final years there.  Does anyone have any idea who I might be thinking of? It's been bugging me, and I'd love to watch some of her old movies again."}
{"query_id": "2582", "query": "I remember this towering building somewhere in the heart of a bustling city, maybe near some famous hills or something. It was this really tall structure, way taller than anything else around it, which made it stand out like a sore thumb, but in a good way. I think it was built back in the 60s, and it had this sleek, modern vibe to it, like something out of a retro-futuristic movie. The architect was someone who studied under some big names in the mid-century modern scene, which probably explains the cool design.  I used to visit a friend who lived there, and I remember the place had this air of exclusivity. There was always someone at the front desk, and I think they had a gym and a pool, but I never used them. The building had this mix of old Hollywood glamour and modern luxury, and I swear I saw a few celebrities in the lobby a couple of times. My friend mentioned that some famous singer and a few actors had places there, but I can't recall their names.  The view from the higher floors was just breathtaking, especially at night when the city lights sparkled below. It felt like you were on top of the world. I think the building was converted from apartments to condos at some point, maybe in the 70s? It was originally developed by some real estate moguls, and I remember hearing about some crazy expensive sales in recent years, like someone buying two units for a ridiculous amount of money.  Does anyone know what I'm talking about? It's been bugging me for a while, and I'd love to get some help piecing this together."}
{"query_id": "2583", "query": "So, there's this movie I watched ages ago, and it's been bugging me because I can't remember the name. It was this intense thriller set in some dusty, almost desolate town. The main guy was this high-up executive, maybe in telecom or something, who somehow gets caught up in a whirlwind of chaos. I remember he was driving through this barren road, and then there's this convoy of shady characters led by this really menacing guy.   The town itself was in a state of turmoil, with a political rally that spirals into violence. There was this scene where a butcher gets killed, and it felt so raw and unsettling. The protagonist ends up helping this woman who was engaged to some local politician, and they go on the run together. They hide out at a friend's place, but things go south quickly, and they have to flee again.   There was a lot of tension, with car chases and close calls. At one point, they try to seek refuge in this old fort, but there's this whole fake news angle that complicates things. The climax was super intense, with a stabbing and a narrow escape. I think there was even a post-credits scene showing the main guy recovering and the woman running for some political position.  I watched it with a friend during a late-night movie marathon, and we were both on the edge of our seats the whole time. The atmosphere was so gripping, with a mix of fear and adrenaline. Does anyone have any idea what this movie could be? It's driving me nuts!"}
{"query_id": "2585", "query": "I remember watching this intense movie ages ago, and it's been bugging me that I can't recall the name. It was about this young guy who gets caught up in a really messy situation. I think he was from Ireland, and somehow he ends up in London. There was something about a bombing, and he gets wrongly accused along with a few others. The whole thing was super tense, with a lot of courtroom drama and prison scenes.  The main guy's dad plays a big role too. I remember their relationship being really central to the story. The dad was this older, kind-hearted man who just wanted to help his son. There was a lot of emotional stuff between them, especially when they were both in prison. I think the dad might have died at some point, which was a really heartbreaking moment.  There was also this lawyer, a woman, who was really determined to prove their innocence. She digs up some crucial evidence that eventually helps clear their names. Oh, and there was this other guy in prison who actually confessed to the crime, but the authorities ignored it to cover up their mistakes.   The movie had this gritty, almost documentary-like feel to it, and the performances were really powerful. I remember feeling a mix of frustration and hope throughout the film. Does anyone have any idea what this movie might be? It's driving me nuts!"}
{"query_id": "2590", "query": "I remember this young footballer who's been making waves recently, but I can't quite put my finger on his name. He's this incredibly talented midfielder, and I think he's from somewhere in Spain, maybe a small town or village. I recall he started out in some local youth teams before moving to a bigger academy, possibly in Seville or somewhere close by. He was quite the prodigy, scoring a ridiculous number of goals as a kid, something like 90 or 100, which is just insane for his age.  He joined one of the top clubs in Spain when he was around 11 or so, and quickly climbed the ranks. I think he made his professional debut not too long ago, maybe a couple of years back, and he's already being compared to some of the club's legends. His playing style is really dynamic  he's got this amazing ability to dribble through tight spaces and his vision on the field is just next level.  I remember hearing that he won some major awards recently, like one for being the best young player in Europe or something, and another that recognizes his overall talent. He also made his debut for the national team at a very young age, breaking some kind of record, and even scored his first goal in a major tournament.  There was something about him helping his team win a few big titles, maybe a league title and a domestic cup. I think he might have had a serious injury recently, but he's still being hailed as one of the brightest talents in football. Does anyone know who I'm talking about? Any help would be appreciated!"}
{"query_id": "2595", "query": "So, there's this movie I watched ages ago, and it's been bugging me because I can't remember the name. It was this quirky, kind of surreal film set in a city that felt very indie and underground. The main guy was this young musician, maybe in his early twenties, playing bass in a band that wasn't exactly hitting the big time. He was dating this high school girl, which his friends weren't too thrilled about, but then he meets this mysterious girl with colorful hair who he had seen in his dreams or something.  The plot gets really wild from there. He ends up having to fight a series of her exes, and each battle was like a different level in a video game, complete with over-the-top action and special effects. There was one ex who was a skateboarder, another who had superpowers, and even a girl who fought with a whip or something. The whole thing had this comic book vibe, with lots of visual gags and pop culture references.  I remember there was a scene where the band was playing in some kind of battle of the bands, and the fights would break out on stage. At one point, the main guy gets this extra life, like in a video game, and he uses it to come back after getting defeated. There was also this evil record producer who was controlling the mysterious girl somehow, and the final showdown took place in this crazy nightclub or theater.  The movie had this mix of humor, romance, and action, and it felt really unique. I watched it with some friends during a movie night, and we were all pretty blown away by how different it was. Does anyone have any idea what this movie could be? It's driving me nuts!"}
{"query_id": "2596", "query": "I remember watching this movie ages ago, and it's been bugging me because I can't recall the name. It was this historical drama set in a really opulent palace, probably in France, with all these extravagant costumes and lavish parties. The main character was this young girl, maybe a teenager, who was sent away from her home to marry some prince or king. She had to leave everything behind, and I think there was a scene where she had to change her clothes and say goodbye to her old life in a pretty dramatic way.  The movie had this mix of modern and classical music, which felt a bit out of place but somehow worked. The girl struggled to fit in with the court's rigid rules and seemed pretty lonely despite all the grandeur around her. There was a lot of gossip and pressure on her to have a child, and I remember she had a few close friends who were her only solace. There was also this awkward tension between her and her husband, who seemed more interested in locks or something mechanical.  At some point, her brother or some relative visited and gave some pretty blunt advice to her husband, which led to them finally having a child. Despite the growing family, she became quite infamous for her lavish spending and was nicknamed something like Madame Debt or Madame Excess. The movie ended on a pretty dark note with the palace being stormed by angry crowds, signaling the end of their luxurious life.  Does anyone know what movie this might be? It's been driving me crazy trying to remember!"}

{"query_id": "2600", "query": "Okay, this is a vague one .\n So I know this is going to be a difficult one. Thank you in advance for reading this.   I saw this on some movie channel on DirecTV (or whatever we had then) when I was a preteen. It was shot sometime in the late 60s or 70s. All I can remember is some woman who wakes up completely naked and starts slowing walking, trying to leave the building. She doesn't care that she's naked and, as she's slowly leaving, security guards are trying to shoot and kill her but she's either a) killing them or b) the pills can't hit her. I can't remember which it is. Also, if it helps, I remember her descending some large stairs in a large, open room.   I know it's a long shot but I would seriously love some help. It's been killing me (no pun intended) for years!"}
