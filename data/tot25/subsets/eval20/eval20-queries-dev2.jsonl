I saw it on t.v., even though I strongly remember it being a movie, and only really remember one scene vividly. I believe there are two kids and they are staying ag this old house in the woods; its a two story house. Not sure if they are on vacation or have parents there. But at one point, one kid gets trapped under water either under tree branches or under ice (but I’m pretty sure its summer so ice would be odd). I think the old woman (witch) is in the window makig this happen.  She is bad, maybe only the kids know it. I think the kid gets out just barely before it (she?) would have died. It was in english.

There was a mother, father, twin brothers; one was a drug dealer with a girlfriend who turned out to be an space alien and the other stayed in his room alone with a rocking horse and masturbated to skinhead imagery, and a younger teenage sister who was slutty. Movie ends in a violent clash with skinheads, alien abduction, and a sleazy lawyer tricking the teenage girl into running away with him (he was going to exploit her in porn). There were a lot blurring of explicit scenes with the girl and some violent imagery. I was shocked as a teenager to find this on a PBS channel, but also fascinated to see a film starring Asian Americans and a really disturbing a bizarre plot (not a terrible film, acting was very decent). Haunts me to this day, really wish I could put a name to it."}

One of the most memorable moments was this female assassin was “transferring” her title and knowledge of fighting to a younger female assassin (the title was something about a white/green snake?) and they literally look at each other and a file download (think old microsoft pop up when you moved a file from one folder to another) popped up and showed the “data” being transferred from the older woman to the younger woman. I think it was made in the early 2000s, maybe late 90s."}

But in the end of the movie he was able to make it to the performance and started singing and acting what I think was a Sweeney Todd musical or something really similar to it cause the play ended with one of them cutting the throat of an old man. everyone was shocked but they clapped cause this very young girl decided to do a dark play. there were also 3 old men who were like friends of the father or related to him or something. They were probably in their 60s. They were in the play too and helping the girl practice for her play. I think the dad had a love interest but I doubt it since the story revolved around the growing bond between the father and daughter. They were having familial trouble because the mom divorced or moved away or died or something (I think. I only really remember the ending with the play.)"}

I watched it on VHS tape in the early 90s at a friend’s house. It is an American movie and in color. I used to think it was a David Lynch film, as we were watching a lot of his other stuff at the time, but after reviewing many of his other titles, it doesn’t seem that it is – although the movie has a similar feel of being filled with disturbing scenes and people. The setting is in an American suburb, I think in the Southwest. The home where much of the movie takes place has a pool in the back yard. The main character is some sort of mentally disturbed weirdo loser. Mainly what I remember at the end is someone (the main character?) packing a suitcase and smiling happily while their mom is angrily calling them from the next room. But at the same time you see a fresh bloodstain slowly growing on the ceiling overhead, suggesting the mom may have been murdered. It isn’t clear which is the hallucination, the voice calling or the growing bloodstain because the movie ends there."}

I thought it was from one of the Ocean Trilogy movies, but I just fast forwarded through all 3 of them and didn’t see it. There’s a tiny chance I missed it but it’s more likely I have the wrong movie. The movie (or possibly TV show episode) is definitely in English and in color and came out between 1995 and 2015 (more likely before 2010). The scene I see has 2 con artists /criminals working together (I think there is actually a large group but this scene focuses on 2). They are in 2 separate lines at airport security. They both have fake passports/identities and they are dressed in character. There characters are very different – while perhaps incorrect, I am picturing Bernie Mac in traditional South African attire and Eddie Jemison as a Rabbi or something. They both get to the front of their security lines and realise they have switched passports so Bernie Mac has to pretend to be a rabbi in his South African attire and Eddie Jemison takes off his yamaka and pretends to be South African. The security agent with Eddie happens to speak the South African language and the crew of con artists get really nervous as they watch Eddie wondering how he’s going to convince the security agent. After a pause, Eddie responds perfectly in the South African language and suprises everyone. They both make it through the security line safely.   Again, I may have the actors and fake identities wrong, but the the concept is definitely correct, and hopefully some of my memory is correct and will spark something in one of your minds!

{"query_id": "667", "query": "Movie with sect applauding, red eye (the god?), and a dwarf in probably London for the last scene .\n Hello!

The movie was in French but may have been an English one. What I saw was a kind of sect in white and the supposed guru trying to talk in front of them but could not say a word as the sect started applauding as soon as he opened the mouth. There was a kind of red eye which I suppose a kind of god of the sect. Then it seems that the guru was chosen to be sacrificed but not explicitly (led to a place with smoke). All this happens inside a building without windows. Then it is the final scene in front of Westminster Abbay or Big Ben in London with a dwarf dancing and jumping for no reason and it ends there.

From that point she is pregnant and soon gives birth to her daughter named Candy/Candi. The movie continues to show that the lady is miserable and wants to be a icon or famous or a model. Eventually her next door neighbors or some people she knows use her for murders and crimes and make it seem like they are agents and she is doing art or “preforming”. Eventually I think Candy/Candi is killed off by her mom. The neighbor people go on trial to convict the main character of her crimes, the main character is killed off by the electric chair. I know this is rather vague but I hope this is enough information. This is all I can remember. Thanks for any help."}
